Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

I can be silent no longer. Please listen to me and vote river. If it was not river i have enough evidence that we can deduce the true mafia in the following rounds.

Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction).

My name is Angel, i have a family of four with my amazing husband Emmett, my eldest son Michael who is 12, and the newest addition to the family my baby girl, maddison. Last night, i was walking home when i witnessed a murder, it was River who did it! The horror. I ran thinking of my newest daughter and how she deserves to grow up with a mother. I can be silent no longer. Please listen to me and vote river. If it was not river i have enough evidence that we can deduce the true mafia in the following rounds.

[22:20:15] Angel: hello everyone, how are you doing today. My name is Angel, i have a family of four with my amazing husband Emmett, my eldest son Michael who is 12, and the newest addition to the family my baby girl, maddison. Last night, i was walking home when i witnessed a murder, it was River who did it! The horror. I ran thinking of my newest daughter and how she deserves to grow up with a mother. I can be silent no longer. Please listen to me and vote river. If it was not river i have enough evidence that we can deduce the true mafia in the following rounds.

Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction).

My name is Angel, i have a family of four with my amazing husband Emmett, my eldest son Michael who is 12, and the newest addition to the family my baby girl, maddison. Last night, i was walking home when i witnessed a murder, it was River who did it! The horror. I ran thinking of my newest daughter and how she deserves to grow up with a mother. I can be silent no longer. Please listen to me and vote river. If it was not river i have enough evidence that we can deduce the true mafia in the following rounds.

Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction).

My name is Angel, i have a family of four with my amazing husband Emmett, my eldest son Michael who is 12, and the newest addition to the family my baby girl, maddison. Last night, i was walking home when i witnessed a murder, it was River who did it! The horror. I ran thinking of my newest daughter and how she deserves to grow up with a mother.

You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time.\nThe rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.\nYou were assigned the following role: bystander.\nThe game's chat room was open at [22:20:15].\nYou can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:\n<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;\n<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.\n\nYou must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens.

[22:20:15] Angel: hello everyone, how are you doing today. My name is Angel, i have a family of four with my amazing husband Emmett, my eldest son Michael who is 12, and the newest addition to the family my baby girl, maddison. Last night, i was walking home when i witnessed a murder, it was River who did it! The horror. I ran thinking of my newest daughter and how she deserves to grow up with a mother. I can be silent no longer. Please listen to me and vote river. If it was not river i have enough evidence that we can deduce the true mafia in the following rounds. For our families, please listen to me.

[22:25:13] Lennon: harper can you check if that hoodie matches remis style
[22:25:15] Kennedy: harper rewind to one minute before 930 to catch anyone arriving

You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time.\nThe rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.\nYou were assigned the following role: bystander.\nThe game's chat room was open at [22:20:15].\nYou can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:\n<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;\n<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.\n\nYou must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens.

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.
You were assigned the following role: bystander.
