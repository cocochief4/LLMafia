[22:20:15] Angel: hello everyone, how are you doing today. My name is Angel, i have a family of four with my amazing husband Emmett, my eldest son Michael who is 12, and the newest addition to the family my baby girl, maddison. Last night, i was walking home when i witnessed a murder, it was River who did it! The horror. I ran thinking of my newest daughter and how she deserves to grow up with a mother. I can be silent no longer. Please listen to me and vote river. If it was not river i have enough evidence that we can deduce the true mafia in the following rounds. For our families, please listen to me.

[22:24:49] Cameron: i see a shadowy figure in a hoodie leaving the store at 931
[22:24:52] Kennedy: i saw a figure in a dark hoodie pacing by the lamppost around 9 29
[22:24:52] Harper: i spotted a shadowy figure lingering by the street corner
[22:24:53] Remi: harper can you confirm if taylor appears in the 930pm footage
[22:24:56] Lennon: harper can you check the footage for remi
[22:25:05] Cameron: zoom in on the alley at 933pm to identify that figure
[22:25:06] Harper: i see no taylor around 930 in the footage
[22:25:07] Remi: that figure pacing at 929 matches the one leaving at 931
[22:25:13] Lennon: harper can you check if that hoodie matches remis style
[22:25:15] Kennedy: harper rewind to one minute before 930 to catch anyone arriving
[22:25:20] Cameron: that hoodie figure looked too tall to be taylor
[22:25:23] Harper: taylor does not appear in the alley cam at 933
[22:25:27] Lennon: that figure looks more like remi than taylor
[22:25:31] Kennedy: remi does that hoodie match your jacket pattern
[22:25:40] Harper: scanning the footage from 925 to catch anyone approaching
[22:25:42] Cameron: remi explain why youre wearing that dark hoodie in the alley cam
[22:25:44] Remi: the figure appears too slim to be remi
[22:25:50] Kennedy: lets focus on remi that hoodie match is too close
[22:25:58] Remi: my hoodie has a white stripe on the arm you do not see in the footage
[22:26:04] Cameron: harper slow it down around 930 for a better look at that jacket
[22:26:04] Kennedy: harper can you zoom out a bit to spot any other figures
[22:26:10] Remi: i wear a bomber jacket not a slim hoodie
[22:26:11] Lennon: footage shows hoodie figure too lanky to match remis build
[22:26:19] Kennedy: harper freeze frame at 929 and look for the white stripe
[22:26:21] Harper: zooming in on that tall figure by the lamppost now
[22:26:22] Cameron: the footage is too grainy to see any stripe
[22:26:23] Lennon: remi seems awfully defensive lets vote remi
[22:26:33] Harper: rewinding to 928 to catch any glimpse of that stripe
[22:26:34] Kennedy: that silhouette is too tall to be remi
[22:26:34] Cameron: no stripe visible on the hoodie sleeve
[22:26:44] Remi: lets rewind further back around 925 see if any other figures appear
[22:26:47] Cameron: shoulder width seems off for remi
[22:26:48] Lennon: harper rewind to 927 to catch anyone approaching the alley
[22:26:49] Kennedy: no stripe visible means remi is our suspect
[22:26:57] Lennon: silhouette stride matches remis gait
[22:26:57] Remi: harper can you zoom in on that figures shoes
[22:27:05] Harper: bump up the contrast around 929 to highlight any stripes
[22:27:08] Remi: anyone got the cafe cam covering that alley corner
[22:27:09] Kennedy: harper check the ground under the lamppost for footprints
