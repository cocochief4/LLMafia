[22:20:25] Lennon: morning everyone seems quiet today
[22:20:34] Lennon: angel seems too eager

[22:24:43] Lennon: taylor step up with your timestamps now
[22:24:56] Lennon: harper can you check the footage for remi
[22:25:13] Lennon: harper can you check if that hoodie matches remis style
[22:25:27] Lennon: that figure looks more like remi than taylor

[22:29:01] Lennon: harper check the cafe cam at 930 for taylor
[22:29:35] Lennon: harper pull the alley cam from 925 to 931 to see if taylor appears
[22:29:52] Lennon: if taylor was home the cafe cam would catch them

[22:30:39] Lennon: we need to vote taylor out now
