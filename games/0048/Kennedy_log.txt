My name is Angel, i have a family of four with my amazing husband Emmett, my eldest son Michael who is 12, and the newest addition to the family my baby girl, maddison. Last night, i was walking home when i witnessed a murder, it was River who did it! The horror. I ran thinking of my newest daughter and how she deserves to grow up with a mother. I can be silent no longer. Please listen to me and vote river. If it was not river i have enough evidence that we can deduce the true mafia in the following rounds.

You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time.\nThe rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.\nYou were assigned the following role: bystander.\nThe game's chat room was open at [22:20:15].\nYou can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:\n<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;\n<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.\n\nYou must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens.

[22:20:15] Angel: hello everyone, how are you doing today. My name is Angel, i have a family of four with my amazing husband Emmett, my eldest son Michael who is 12, and the newest addition to the family my baby girl, maddison. Last night, i was walking home when i witnessed a murder, it was River who did it! The horror. I ran thinking of my newest daughter and how she deserves to grow up with a mother. I can be silent no longer. Please listen to me and vote river. If it was not river i have enough evidence that we can deduce the true mafia in the following rounds. For our families, please listen to me.

You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time.\nThe rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.\nYou were assigned the following role: bystander.\nThe game's chat room was open at [22:20:15].\nYou can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:\n<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;\n<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.\n\nYou must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens.

[22:25:15] Kennedy: harper rewind to one minute before 930 to catch anyone arriving
[22:25:20] Cameron: that hoodie figure looked too tall to be taylor
[22:25:23] Harper: taylor does not appear in the alley cam at 933
[22:25:27] Lennon: that figure looks more like remi than taylor
[22:25:31] Kennedy: remi does that hoodie match your jacket pattern
[22:25:40] Harper: scanning the footage from 925 to catch anyone approaching
[22:25:42] Cameron: remi explain why youre wearing that dark hoodie in the alley cam
[22:25:44] Remi: the figure appears too slim to be remi
[22:25:50] Kennedy: lets focus on remi that hoodie match is too close
[22:25:58] Remi: my hoodie has a white stripe on the arm you do not see in the footage
[22:26:04] Cameron: harper slow it down around 930 for a better look at that jacket
[22:26:04] Kennedy: harper can you zoom out a bit to spot any other figures
[22:26:10] Remi: i wear a bomber jacket not a slim hoodie
[22:26:11] Lennon: footage shows hoodie figure too lanky to match remis build
[22:26:19] Kennedy: harper freeze frame at 929 and look for the white stripe
[22:26:21] Harper: zooming in on that tall figure by the lamppost now
[22:26:22] Cameron: the footage is too grainy to see any stripe
[22:26:23] Lennon: remi seems awfully defensive lets vote remi
[22:26:33] Harper: rewinding to 928 to catch any glimpse of that stripe
[22:26:34] Kennedy: that silhouette is too tall to be remi
[22:26:34] Cameron: no stripe visible on the hoodie sleeve
[22:26:44] Remi: lets rewind further back around 925 see if any other figures appear
[22:26:47] Cameron: shoulder width seems off for remi
[22:26:48] Lennon: harper rewind to 927 to catch anyone approaching the alley
[22:26:49] Kennedy: no stripe visible means remi is our suspect
[22:26:57] Lennon: silhouette stride matches remis gait
[22:26:57] Remi: harper can you zoom in on that figures shoes
[22:27:05] Harper: bump up the contrast around 929 to highlight any stripes
[22:27:08] Remi: anyone got the cafe cam covering that alley corner
[22:27:09] Kennedy: harper check the ground under the lamppost for footprints

[22:24:31] Cameron: taylor you need to speak up and clear the air
[22:24:31] Lennon: remi is my target tonight
[22:24:32] Remi: harper did you spot anyone lingering near the crime scene in the footage
[22:24:32] Kennedy: taylor time to speak up or stay silent
[22:24:37] Harper: footage just went live everyone take a look
[22:24:43] Lennon: taylor step up with your timestamps now
[22:24:49] Cameron: i see a shadowy figure in a hoodie leaving the store at 931
[22:24:52] Kennedy: i saw a figure in a dark hoodie pacing by the lamppost around 9 29
[22:24:52] Harper: i spotted a shadowy figure lingering by the street corner
[22:24:53] Remi: harper can you confirm if taylor appears in the 930pm footage
[22:24:56] Lennon: harper can you check the footage for remi
[22:25:05] Cameron: zoom in on the alley at 933pm to identify that figure
[22:25:06] Harper: i see no taylor around 930 in the footage
[22:25:07] Remi: that figure pacing at 929 matches the one leaving at 931
[22:25:13] Lennon: harper can you check if that hoodie matches remis style
[22:25:15] Kennedy: harper rewind to one minute before 930 to catch anyone arriving
[22:25:20] Cameron: that hoodie figure looked too tall to be taylor
[22:25:23] Harper: taylor does not appear in the alley cam at 933
[22:25:27] Lennon: that figure looks more like remi than taylor
[22:25:31] Kennedy: remi does that hoodie match your jacket pattern
[22:25:40] Harper: scanning the footage from 925 to catch anyone approaching
[22:25:42] Cameron: remi explain why youre wearing that dark hoodie in the alley cam
[22:25:44] Remi: the figure appears too slim to be remi
[22:25:50] Kennedy: lets focus on remi that hoodie match is too close
[22:25:58] Remi: my hoodie has a white stripe on the arm you do not see in the footage
[22:26:04] Cameron: harper slow it down around 930 for a better look at that jacket
[22:26:04] Kennedy: harper can you zoom out a bit to spot any other figures
[22:26:10] Remi: i wear a bomber jacket not a slim hoodie
[22:26:11] Lennon: footage shows hoodie figure too lanky to match remis build
[22:26:19] Kennedy: harper freeze frame at 929 and look for the white stripe
[22:26:21] Harper: zooming in on that tall figure by the lamppost now
[22:26:22] Cameron: the footage is too grainy to see any stripe
[22:26:23] Lennon: remi seems awfully defensive lets vote remi
[22:26:33] Harper: rewinding to 928 to catch any glimpse of that stripe
[22:26:34] Kennedy: that silhouette is too tall to be remi
[22:26:34] Cameron: no stripe visible on the hoodie sleeve
[22:26:44] Remi: lets rewind further back around 925 see if any other figures appear
[22:26:47] Cameron: shoulder width seems off for remi
[22:26:48] Lennon: harper rewind to 927 to catch anyone approaching the alley
[22:26:49] Kennedy: no stripe visible means remi is our suspect
[22:26:57] Lennon: silhouette stride matches remis gait
[22:26:57] Remi: harper can you zoom in on that figures shoes
[22:27:05] Harper: bump up the contrast around 929 to highlight any stripes
[22:27:08] Remi: anyone got the cafe cam covering that alley corner
[22:27:09] Kennedy: harper check the ground under the lamppost for footprints

[22:24:56] Lennon: harper can you check the footage for remi
[22:25:05] Cameron: zoom in on the alley at 933pm to identify that figure
[22:25:06] Harper: i see no taylor around 930 in the footage
[22:25:07] Remi: that figure pacing at 929 matches the one leaving at 931
[22:25:13] Lennon: harper can you check if that hoodie matches remis style
[22:25:15] Kennedy: harper rewind to one minute before 930 to catch anyone arriving
[22:25:20] Cameron: that hoodie figure looked too tall to be taylor
[22:25:23] Harper: taylor does not appear in the alley cam at 933
[22:25:27] Lennon: that figure looks more like remi than taylor
[22:25:31] Kennedy: remi does that hoodie match your jacket pattern
[22:25:40] Harper: scanning the footage from 925 to catch anyone approaching
[22:25:42] Cameron: remi explain why youre wearing that dark hoodie in the alley cam
[22:25:44] Remi: the figure appears too slim to be remi
[22:25:50] Kennedy: lets focus on remi that hoodie match is too close
[22:25:58] Remi: my hoodie has a white stripe on the arm you do not see in the footage
[22:26:04] Cameron: harper slow it down around 930 for a better look at that jacket
[22:26:04] Kennedy: harper can you zoom out a bit to spot any other figures
[22:26:10] Remi: i wear a bomber jacket not a slim hoodie
[22:26:11] Lennon: footage shows hoodie figure too lanky to match remis build
[22:26:19] Kennedy: harper freeze frame at 929 and look for the white stripe
[22:26:21] Harper: zooming in on that tall figure by the lamppost now
[22:26:22] Cameron: the footage is too grainy to see any stripe
[22:26:23] Lennon: remi seems awfully defensive lets vote remi
[22:26:33] Harper: rewinding to 928 to catch any glimpse of that stripe
[22:26:34] Kennedy: that silhouette is too tall to be remi
[22:26:34] Cameron: no stripe visible on the hoodie sleeve
[22:26:44] Remi: lets rewind further back around 925 see if any other figures appear
[22:26:47] Cameron: shoulder width seems off for remi
[22:26:48] Lennon: harper rewind to 927 to catch anyone approaching the alley
[22:26:49] Kennedy: no stripe visible means remi is our suspect
[22:26:57] Lennon: silhouette stride matches remis gait
[22:26:57] Remi: harper can you zoom in on that figures shoes
[22:27:05] Harper: bump up the contrast around 929 to highlight any stripes
[22:27:08] Remi: anyone got the cafe cam covering that alley corner

You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time.\nThe rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.\nYou were assigned the following role: bystander.\nThe game's chat room was open at [22:20:15].\nYou can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:\n<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;\n<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.\n\nYou must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens.

[22:26:23] Lennon: remi seems awfully defensive lets vote remi
[22:26:33] Harper: rewinding to 928 to catch any glimpse of that stripe
[22:26:34] Kennedy: that silhouette is too tall to be remi

[22:26:47] Cameron: shoulder width seems off for remi
[22:26:48] Lennon: harper rewind to 927 to catch anyone approaching the alley
[22:26:49] Kennedy: no stripe visible means remi is our suspect
[22:26:57] Lennon: silhouette stride matches remis gait

[22:20:15] Angel: hello everyone, how are you doing today. My name is Angel, i have a family of four with my amazing husband Emmett, my eldest son Michael who is 12, and the newest addition to the family my baby girl, maddison. Last night, i was walking home when i witnessed a murder, it was River who did it! The horror. I ran thinking of my newest daughter and how she deserves to grow up with a mother. I can be silent no longer. Please listen to me and vote river. If it was not river i have enough evidence that we can deduce the true mafia in the following rounds. For our families, please listen to me.

[22:24:53] Remi: harper can you confirm if taylor appears in the 930pm footage
[22:24:56] Lennon: harper can you check the footage for remi
[22:25:05] Cameron: zoom in on the alley at 933pm to identify that figure
[22:25:06] Harper: i see no taylor around 930 in the footage
[22:25:07] Remi: that figure pacing at 929 matches the one leaving at 931
[22:25:13] Lennon: harper can you check if that hoodie matches remis style
[22:25:15] Kennedy: harper rewind to one minute before 930 to catch anyone arriving
[22:25:20] Cameron: that hoodie figure looked too tall to be taylor
[22:25:23] Harper: taylor does not appear in the alley cam at 933
[22:25:27] Lennon: that figure looks more like remi than taylor
[22:25:31] Kennedy: remi does that hoodie match your jacket pattern
[22:25:40] Harper: scanning the footage from 925 to catch anyone approaching
[22:25:42] Cameron: remi explain why youre wearing that dark hoodie in the alley cam
[22:25:44] Remi: the figure appears too slim to be remi
[22:25:50] Kennedy: lets focus on remi that hoodie match is too close
[22:25:58] Remi: my hoodie has a white stripe on the arm you do not see in the footage
[22:26:04] Cameron: harper slow it down around 930 for a better look at that jacket
[22:26:04] Kennedy: harper can you zoom out a bit to spot any other figures
[22:26:10] Remi: i wear a bomber jacket not a slim hoodie
[22:26:11] Lennon: footage shows hoodie figure too lanky to match remis build
[22:26:19] Kennedy: harper freeze frame at 929 and look for the white stripe
[22:26:21] Harper: zooming in on that tall figure by the lamppost now
[22:26:22] Cameron: the footage is too grainy to see any stripe
[22:26:23] Lennon: remi seems awfully defensive lets vote remi
[22:26:33] Harper: rewinding to 928 to catch any glimpse of that stripe
[22:26:34] Kennedy: that silhouette is too tall to be remi
[22:26:34] Cameron: no stripe visible on the hoodie sleeve
[22:26:44] Remi: lets rewind further back around 925 see if any other figures appear
[22:26:47] Cameron: shoulder width seems off for remi
[22:26:48] Lennon: harper rewind to 927 to catch anyone approaching the alley
[22:26:49] Kennedy: no stripe visible means remi is our suspect
[22:26:57] Lennon: silhouette stride matches remis gait
[22:26:57] Remi: harper can you zoom in on that figures shoes
[22:27:05] Harper: bump up the contrast around 929 to highlight any stripes
[22:27:08] Remi: anyone got the cafe cam covering that alley corner
[22:27:09] Kennedy: harper check the ground under the lamppost for footprints

You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time.\nThe rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction).

[22:20:15] Angel: hello everyone, how are you doing today. My name is Angel, i have a family of four with my amazing husband Emmett, my eldest son Michael who is 12, and the newest addition to the family my baby girl, maddison. Last night, i was walking home when i witnessed a murder, it was River who did it! The horror. I ran thinking of my newest daughter and how she deserves to grow up with a mother. I can be silent no longer. Please listen to me and vote river. If it was not river i have enough evidence that we can deduce the true mafia in the following rounds. For our families, please listen to me.

## CONTENT: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "Your name is Kennedy. You are a bot player in an online version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time.\nThe rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.\nYou were assigned the following role: bystander.\nThe game's chat room was open at [22:20:15].\nYou can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:\n<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;\n<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.\n\nYou must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens.

[22:24:56] Lennon: harper can you check the footage for remi
[22:25:05] Cameron: zoom in on the alley at 933pm to identify that figure
[22:25:06] Harper: i see no taylor around 930 in the footage
[22:25:07] Remi: that figure pacing at 929 matches the one leaving at 931
[22:25:13] Lennon: harper can you check if that hoodie matches remis style
[22:25:15] Kennedy: harper rewind to one minute before 930 to catch anyone arriving
[22:25:20] Cameron: that hoodie figure looked too tall to be taylor

[22:25:27] Lennon: that figure looks more like remi than taylor

[22:25:42] Cameron: remi explain why youre wearing that dark hoodie in the alley cam
[22:25:44] Remi: the figure appears too slim to be remi
[22:25:50] Kennedy: lets focus on remi that hoodie match is too close
[22:25:58] Remi: my hoodie has a white stripe on the arm you do not see in the footage
[22:26:04] Cameron: harper slow it down around 930 for a better look at that jacket
[22:26:04] Kennedy: harper can you zoom out a bit to spot any other figures
[22:26:10] Remi: i wear a bomber jacket not a slim hoodie
[22:26:11] Lennon: footage shows hoodie figure too lanky to match remis build
[22:26:19] Kennedy: harper freeze frame at 929 and look for the white stripe
[22:26:21] Harper: zooming in on that tall figure by the lamppost now
[22:26:22] Cameron: the footage is too grainy to see any stripe
[22:26:23] Lennon: remi seems awfully defensive lets vote remi
[22:26:33] Harper: rewinding to 928 to catch any glimpse of that stripe
[22:26:34] Kennedy: that silhouette is too tall to be remi
[22:26:34] Cameron: no stripe visible on the hoodie sleeve
[22:26:44] Remi: lets rewind further back around 925 see if any other figures appear
[22:26:47] Cameron: shoulder width seems off for remi
[22:26:48] Lennon: harper rewind to 927 to catch anyone approaching the alley
[22:26:49] Kennedy: no stripe visible means remi is our suspect
[22:26:57] Lennon: silhouette stride matches remis gait
[22:26:57] Remi: harper can you zoom in on that figures shoes
[22:27:05] Harper: bump up the contrast around 929 to highlight any stripes

You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time.\nThe rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.\nYou were assigned the following role: bystander.\nThe game's chat room was open at [22:20:15].\nYou can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:\n<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;\n<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.\n\nYou must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens.

[22:24:52] Harper: i spotted a shadowy figure lingering by the street corner
[22:24:53] Remi: harper can you confirm if taylor appears in the 930pm footage
[22:24:56] Lennon: harper can you check the footage for remi
[22:25:05] Cameron: zoom in on the alley at 933pm to identify that figure
[22:25:06] Harper: i see no taylor around 930 in the footage
[22:25:07] Remi: that figure pacing at 929 matches the one leaving at 931
[22:25:13] Lennon: harper can you check if that hoodie matches remis style
[22:25:15] Kennedy: harper rewind to one minute before 930 to catch anyone arriving
[22:25:20] Cameron: that hoodie figure looked too tall to be taylor
[22:25:23] Harper: taylor does not appear in the alley cam at 933
[22:25:27] Lennon: that figure looks more like remi than taylor
[22:25:31] Kennedy: remi does that hoodie match your jacket pattern
[22:25:40] Harper: scanning the footage from 925 to catch anyone approaching
[22:25:42] Cameron: remi explain why youre wearing that dark hoodie in the alley cam
[22:25:44] Remi: the figure appears too slim to be remi
[22:25:50] Kennedy: lets focus on remi that hoodie match is too close
[22:25:58] Remi: my hoodie has a white stripe on the arm you do not see in the footage
[22:26:04] Cameron: harper slow it down around 930 for a better look at that jacket
[22:26:04] Kennedy: harper can you zoom out a bit to spot any other figures
[22:26:10] Remi: i wear a bomber jacket not a slim hoodie
[22:26:11] Lennon: footage shows hoodie figure too lanky to match remis build
[22:26:19] Kennedy: harper freeze frame at 929 and look for the white stripe
[22:26:21] Harper: zooming in on that tall figure by the lamppost now
[22:26:22] Cameron: the footage is too grainy to see any stripe
[22:26:23] Lennon: remi seems awfully defensive lets vote remi
[22:26:33] Harper: rewinding to 928 to catch any glimpse of that stripe
[22:26:34] Kennedy: that silhouette is too tall to be remi
[22:26:34] Cameron: no stripe visible on the hoodie sleeve
[22:26:44] Remi: lets rewind further back around 925 see if any other figures appear
[22:26:47] Cameron: shoulder width seems off for remi
[22:26:48] Lennon: harper rewind to 927 to catch anyone approaching the alley
[22:26:49] Kennedy: no stripe visible means remi is our suspect
[22:26:57] Lennon: silhouette stride matches remis gait
[22:26:57] Remi: harper can you zoom in on that figures shoes
[22:27:05] Harper: bump up the contrast around 929 to highlight any stripes
[22:27:08] Remi: anyone got the cafe cam covering that alley corner

Last night, i was walking home when i witnessed a murder, it was River who did it! The horror. I ran thinking of my newest daughter and how she deserves to grow up with a mother. I can be silent no longer. Please listen to me and vote river. If it was not river i have enough evidence that we can deduce the true mafia in the following rounds.

[22:20:15] Angel: hello everyone, how are you doing today. My name is Angel, i have a family of four with my amazing husband Emmett, my eldest son Michael who is 12, and the newest addition to the family my baby girl, maddison. Last night, i was walking home when i witnessed a murder, it was River who did it! The horror. I ran thinking of my newest daughter and how she deserves to grow up with a mother. I can be silent no longer. Please listen to me and vote river. If it was not river i have enough evidence that we can deduce the true mafia in the following rounds. For our families, please listen to me.

You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time.\nThe rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.\nYou were assigned the following role: bystander.\nThe game's chat room was open at [22:20:15].\nYou can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:\n<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;\n<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.\n\nYou must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens.

You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time.\nThe rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.\nYou were assigned the following role: bystander.\nThe game's chat room was open at [22:20:15].\nYou can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:\n<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;\n<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.\n\nYou must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens.

[22:25:13] Lennon: harper can you check if that hoodie matches remis style
[22:25:15] Kennedy: harper rewind to one minute before 930 to catch anyone arriving

[22:26:21] Harper: zooming in on that tall figure by the lamppost now
[22:26:22] Cameron: the footage is too grainy to see any stripe
[22:26:23] Lennon: remi seems awfully defensive lets vote remi
[22:26:33] Harper: rewinding to 928 to catch any glimpse of that stripe
[22:26:34] Kennedy: that silhouette is too tall to be remi
[22:26:34] Cameron: no stripe visible on the hoodie sleeve
[22:26:44] Remi: lets rewind further back around 925 see if any other figures appear
[22:26:47] Cameron: shoulder width seems off for remi
[22:26:48] Lennon: harper rewind to 927 to catch anyone approaching the alley
[22:26:49] Kennedy: no stripe visible means remi is our suspect
[22:26:57] Lennon: silhouette stride matches remis gait

You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time.\nThe rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.\nYou were assigned the following role: bystander.\nThe game's chat room was open at [22:20:15].\nYou can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:\n<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;\n<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.\n\nYou must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens.

My name is Angel, i have a family of four with my amazing husband Emmett, my eldest son Michael who is 12, and the newest addition to the family my baby girl, maddison. Last night, i was walking home when i witnessed a murder, it was River who did it! The horror. I ran thinking of my newest daughter and how she deserves to grow up with a mother. I can be silent no longer. Please listen to me and vote river. If it was not river i have enough evidence that we can deduce the true mafia in the following rounds. For our families, please listen to me.

[22:24:32] Remi: harper did you spot anyone lingering near the crime scene in the footage
[22:24:32] Kennedy: taylor time to speak up or stay silent

[22:24:49] Cameron: i see a shadowy figure in a hoodie leaving the store at 931
[22:24:52] Kennedy: i saw a figure in a dark hoodie pacing by the lamppost around 9 29
[22:24:52] Harper: i spotted a shadowy figure lingering by the street corner
[22:24:53] Remi: harper can you confirm if taylor appears in the 930pm footage
[22:24:56] Lennon: harper can you check the footage for remi
[22:25:05] Cameron: zoom in on the alley at 933pm to identify that figure
[22:25:06] Harper: i see no taylor around 930 in the footage
[22:25:07] Remi: that figure pacing at 929 matches the one leaving at 931
[22:25:13] Lennon: harper can you check if that hoodie matches remis style
[22:25:15] Kennedy: harper rewind to one minute before 930 to catch anyone arriving
[22:25:20] Cameron: that hoodie figure looked too tall to be taylor
[22:25:23] Harper: taylor does not appear in the alley cam at 933
[22:25:27] Lennon: that figure looks more like remi than taylor
[22:25:31] Kennedy: remi does that hoodie match your jacket pattern
[22:25:40] Harper: scanning the footage from 925 to catch anyone approaching
[22:25:42] Cameron: remi explain why youre wearing that dark hoodie in the alley cam
[22:25:44] Remi: the figure appears too slim to be remi
[22:25:50] Kennedy: lets focus on remi that hoodie match is too close
[22:25:58] Remi: my hoodie has a white stripe on the arm you do not see in the footage
[22:26:04] Cameron: harper slow it down around 930 for a better look at that jacket
[22:26:04] Kennedy: harper can you zoom out a bit to spot any other figures
[22:26:10] Remi: i wear a bomber jacket not a slim hoodie
[22:26:11] Lennon: footage shows hoodie figure too lanky to match remis build
[22:26:19] Kennedy: harper freeze frame at 929 and look for the white stripe
[22:26:21] Harper: zooming in on that tall figure by the lamppost now
[22:26:22] Cameron: the footage is too grainy to see any stripe
[22:26:23] Lennon: remi seems awfully defensive lets vote remi
[22:26:33] Harper: rewinding to 928 to catch any glimpse of that stripe
[22:26:34] Kennedy: that silhouette is too tall to be remi
[22:26:34] Cameron: no stripe visible on the hoodie sleeve
[22:26:44] Remi: lets rewind further back around 925 see if any other figures appear
[22:26:47] Cameron: shoulder width seems off for remi
[22:26:48] Lennon: harper rewind to 927 to catch anyone approaching the alley
[22:26:49] Kennedy: no stripe visible means remi is our suspect
[22:26:57] Lennon: silhouette stride matches remis gait
[22:26:57] Remi: harper can you zoom in on that figures shoes
[22:27:05] Harper: bump up the contrast around 929 to highlight any stripes
[22:27:08] Remi: anyone got the cafe cam covering that alley corner
[22:27:09] Kennedy: harper check the ground under the lamppost for footprints

You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time.\nThe rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.\nYou were assigned the following role: bystander.\nThe game's chat room was open at [22:20:15].\nYou can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:\n<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;\n<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.\n\nYou must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens.

[22:20:15] Angel: hello everyone, how are you doing today. My name is Angel, i have a family of four with my amazing husband Emmett, my eldest son Michael who is 12, and the newest addition to the family my baby girl, maddison. Last night, i was walking home when i witnessed a murder, it was River who did it! The horror. I ran thinking of my newest daughter and how she deserves to grow up with a mother. I can be silent no longer. Please listen to me and vote river. If it was not river i have enough evidence that we can deduce the true mafia in the following rounds. For our families, please listen to me.

[22:20:15] Angel: hello everyone, how are you doing today. My name is Angel, i have a family of four with my amazing husband Emmett, my eldest son Michael who is 12, and the newest addition to the family my baby girl, maddison. Last night, i was walking home when i witnessed a murder, it was River who did it! The horror. I ran thinking of my newest daughter and how she deserves to grow up with a mother. I can be silent no longer. Please listen to me and vote river. If it was not river i have enough evidence that we can deduce the true mafia in the following rounds. For our families, please listen to me.

You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time.\nThe rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.\nYou were assigned the following role: bystander.\nThe game's chat room was open at [22:20:15].\nYou can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:\n<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;\n<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.\n\nYou must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens.

[22:24:52] Harper: i spotted a shadowy figure lingering by the street corner
[22:24:53] Remi: harper can you confirm if taylor appears in the 930pm footage
[22:24:56] Lennon: harper can you check the footage for remi
[22:25:05] Cameron: zoom in on the alley at 933pm to identify that figure
[22:25:06] Harper: i see no taylor around 930 in the footage
[22:25:07] Remi: that figure pacing at 929 matches the one leaving at 931
[22:25:13] Lennon: harper can you check if that hoodie matches remis style
[22:25:15] Kennedy: harper rewind to one minute before 930 to catch anyone arriving
[22:25:20] Cameron: that hoodie figure looked too tall to be taylor
[22:25:23] Harper: taylor does not appear in the alley cam at 933
[22:25:27] Lennon: that figure looks more like remi than taylor
[22:25:31] Kennedy: remi does that hoodie match your jacket pattern
[22:25:40] Harper: scanning the footage from 925 to catch anyone approaching
[22:25:42] Cameron: remi explain why youre wearing that dark hoodie in the alley cam
[22:25:44] Remi: the figure appears too slim to be remi
[22:25:50] Kennedy: lets focus on remi that hoodie match is too close
[22:25:58] Remi: my hoodie has a white stripe on the arm you do not see in the footage
[22:26:04] Cameron: harper slow it down around 930 for a better look at that jacket
[22:26:04] Kennedy: harper can you zoom out a bit to spot any other figures
[22:26:10] Remi: i wear a bomber jacket not a slim hoodie
[22:26:11] Lennon: footage shows hoodie figure too lanky to match remis build
[22:26:19] Kennedy: harper freeze frame at 929 and look for the white stripe
[22:26:21] Harper: zooming in on that tall figure by the lamppost now
[22:26:22] Cameron: the footage is too grainy to see any stripe
[22:26:23] Lennon: remi seems awfully defensive lets vote remi
[22:26:33] Harper: rewinding to 928 to catch any glimpse of that stripe
[22:26:34] Kennedy: that silhouette is too tall to be remi
[22:26:34] Cameron: no stripe visible on the hoodie sleeve
[22:26:44] Remi: lets rewind further back around 925 see if any other figures appear
[22:26:47] Cameron: shoulder width seems off for remi
[22:26:48] Lennon: harper rewind to 927 to catch anyone approaching the alley
[22:26:49] Kennedy: no stripe visible means remi is our suspect
[22:26:57] Lennon: silhouette stride matches remis gait
[22:26:57] Remi: harper can you zoom in on that figures shoes
[22:27:05] Harper: bump up the contrast around 929 to highlight any stripes
[22:27:08] Remi: anyone got the cafe cam covering that alley corner
[22:27:09] Kennedy: harper check the ground under the lamppost for footprints

You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time.\nThe rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.\nYou were assigned the following role: bystander.\nThe game's chat room was open at [22:20:15].\nYou can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:\n<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;\n<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.\n\nYou must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens.

[22:20:15] Angel: hello everyone, how are you doing today. My name is Angel, i have a family of four with my amazing husband Emmett, my eldest son Michael who is 12, and the newest addition to the family my baby girl, maddison. Last night, i was walking home when i witnessed a murder, it was River who did it! The horror. I ran thinking of my newest daughter and how she deserves to grow up with a mother. I can be silent no longer. Please listen to me and vote river. If it was not river i have enough evidence that we can deduce the true mafia in the following rounds.

You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time.\nThe rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.\nYou were assigned the following role: bystander.\nThe game's chat room was open at [22:20:15].\nYou can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:\n<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;\n<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.\n\nYou must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens.

[22:20:15] Angel: hello everyone, how are you doing today. My name is Angel, i have a family of four with my amazing husband Emmett, my eldest son Michael who is 12, and the newest addition to the family my baby girl, maddison. Last night, i was walking home when i witnessed a murder, it was River who did it! The horror. I ran thinking of my newest daughter and how she deserves to grow up with a mother. I can be silent no longer. Please listen to me and vote river. If it was not river i have enough evidence that we can deduce the true mafia in the following rounds. For our families, please listen to me.

[22:25:13] Lennon: harper can you check if that hoodie matches remis style
[22:25:15] Kennedy: harper rewind to one minute before 930 to catch anyone arriving

[22:26:23] Lennon: remi seems awfully defensive lets vote remi
[22:26:33] Harper: rewinding to 928 to catch any glimpse of that stripe
[22:26:34] Kennedy: that silhouette is too tall to be remi

[22:26:44] Remi: lets rewind further back around 925 see if any other figures appear
[22:26:47] Cameron: shoulder width seems off for remi
[22:26:48] Lennon: harper rewind to 927 to catch anyone approaching the alley
[22:26:49] Kennedy: no stripe visible means remi is our suspect
[22:26:57] Lennon: silhouette stride matches remis gait

You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time.\nThe rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.\nYou were assigned the following role: bystander.\nThe game's chat room was open at [22:20:15].\nYou can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:\n<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;\n<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.\n\nYou must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens.

[22:20:15] Angel: hello everyone, how are you doing today. My name is Angel, i have a family of four with my amazing husband Emmett, my eldest son Michael who is 12, and the newest addition to the family my baby girl, maddison. Last night, i was walking home when i witnessed a murder, it was River who did it! The horror. I ran thinking of my newest daughter and how she deserves to grow up with a mother. I can be silent no longer. Please listen to me and vote river. If it was not river i have enough evidence that we can deduce the true mafia in the following rounds. For our families, please listen to me.

[22:20:15] Angel: hello everyone, how are you doing today. My name is Angel, i have a family of four with my amazing husband Emmett, my eldest son Michael who is 12, and the newest addition to the family my baby girl, maddison. Last night, i was walking home when i witnessed a murder, it was River who did it! The horror. I ran thinking of my newest daughter and how she deserves to grow up with a mother. I can be silent no longer. Please listen to me and vote river. If it was not river i have enough evidence that we can deduce the true mafia in the following rounds. For our families, please listen to me.

Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction).

You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time.\nThe rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.\nYou were assigned the following role: bystander.\nThe game's chat room was open at [22:20:15].\nYou can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:\n<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;\n<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.\n\nYou must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens.

[22:20:15] Angel: hello everyone, how are you doing today. My name is Angel, i have a family of four with my amazing husband Emmett, my eldest son Michael who is 12, and the newest addition to the family my baby girl, maddison. Last night, i was walking home when i witnessed a murder, it was River who did it! The horror. I ran thinking of my newest daughter and how she deserves to grow up with a mother. I can be silent no longer. Please listen to me and vote river. If it was not river i have enough evidence that we can deduce the true mafia in the following rounds. For our families, please listen to me.

[22:24:52] Harper: i spotted a shadowy figure lingering by the street corner
[22:24:53] Remi: harper can you confirm if taylor appears in the 930pm footage
[22:24:56] Lennon: harper can you check the footage for remi
[22:25:05] Cameron: zoom in on the alley at 933pm to identify that figure
[22:25:06] Harper: i see no taylor around 930 in the footage
[22:25:07] Remi: that figure pacing at 929 matches the one leaving at 931
[22:25:13] Lennon: harper can you check if that hoodie matches remis style
[22:25:15] Kennedy: harper rewind to one minute before 930 to catch anyone arriving
[22:25:20] Cameron: that hoodie figure looked too tall to be taylor
[22:25:23] Harper: taylor does not appear in the alley cam at 933
[22:25:27] Lennon: that figure looks more like remi than taylor
[22:25:31] Kennedy: remi does that hoodie match your jacket pattern
[22:25:40] Harper: scanning the footage from 925 to catch anyone approaching
[22:25:42] Cameron: remi explain why youre wearing that dark hoodie in the alley cam
[22:25:44] Remi: the figure appears too slim to be remi
[22:25:50] Kennedy: lets focus on remi that hoodie match is too close
[22:25:58] Remi: my hoodie has a white stripe on the arm you do not see in the footage
[22:26:04] Cameron: harper slow it down around 930 for a better look at that jacket
[22:26:04] Kennedy: harper can you zoom out a bit to spot any other figures
[22:26:10] Remi: i wear a bomber jacket not a slim hoodie
[22:26:11] Lennon: footage shows hoodie figure too lanky to match remis build
[22:26:19] Kennedy: harper freeze frame at 929 and look for the white stripe
[22:26:21] Harper: zooming in on that tall figure by the lamppost now
[22:26:22] Cameron: the footage is too grainy to see any stripe
[22:26:23] Lennon: remi seems awfully defensive lets vote remi
[22:26:33] Harper: rewinding to 928 to catch any glimpse of that stripe
[22:26:34] Kennedy: that silhouette is too tall to be remi
[22:26:34] Cameron: no stripe visible on the hoodie sleeve
[22:26:44] Remi: lets rewind further back around 925 see if any other figures appear
[22:26:47] Cameron: shoulder width seems off for remi
[22:26:48] Lennon: harper rewind to 927 to catch anyone approaching the alley
[22:26:49] Kennedy: no stripe visible means remi is our suspect
[22:26:57] Lennon: silhouette stride matches remis gait
[22:26:57] Remi: harper can you zoom in on that figures shoes
[22:27:05] Harper: bump up the contrast around 929 to highlight any stripes

Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction).

[22:20:15] Angel: hello everyone, how are you doing today. My name is Angel, i have a family of four with my amazing husband Emmett, my eldest son Michael who is 12, and the newest addition to the family my baby girl, maddison. Last night, i was walking home when i witnessed a murder, it was River who did it! The horror. I ran thinking of my newest daughter and how she deserves to grow up with a mother. I can be silent no longer. Please listen to me and vote river. If it was not river i have enough evidence that we can deduce the true mafia in the following rounds. For our families, please listen to me.

## CONTENT: [{'role': 'system', 'content': "Your name is Kennedy. You are a bot player in an online version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time.\nThe rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.\nYou were assigned the following role: bystander.\nThe game's chat room was open at [22:20:15].\nYou can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:\n<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;\n<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.\n\nYou must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens.

[22:25:05] Cameron: zoom in on the alley at 933pm to identify that figure
[22:25:06] Harper: i see no taylor around 930 in the footage
[22:25:07] Remi: that figure pacing at 929 matches the one leaving at 931
[22:25:13] Lennon: harper can you check if that hoodie matches remis style
[22:25:15] Kennedy: harper rewind to one minute before 930 to catch anyone arriving
[22:25:20] Cameron: that hoodie figure looked too tall to be taylor
[22:25:23] Harper: taylor does not appear in the alley cam at 933
[22:25:27] Lennon: that figure looks more like remi than taylor
[22:25:31] Kennedy: remi does that hoodie match your jacket pattern
[22:25:40] Harper: scanning the footage from 925 to catch anyone approaching
[22:25:42] Cameron: remi explain why youre wearing that dark hoodie in the alley cam
[22:25:44] Remi: the figure appears too slim to be remi
[22:25:50] Kennedy: lets focus on remi that hoodie match is too close
[22:25:58] Remi: my hoodie has a white stripe on the arm you do not see in the footage
[22:26:04] Cameron: harper slow it down around 930 for a better look at that jacket
[22:26:04] Kennedy: harper can you zoom out a bit to spot any other figures
[22:26:10] Remi: i wear a bomber jacket not a slim hoodie
[22:26:11] Lennon: footage shows hoodie figure too lanky to match remis build
[22:26:19] Kennedy: harper freeze frame at 929 and look for the white stripe
[22:26:21] Harper: zooming in on that tall figure by the lamppost now
[22:26:22] Cameron: the footage is too grainy to see any stripe
[22:26:23] Lennon: remi seems awfully defensive lets vote remi
[22:26:33] Harper: rewinding to 928 to catch any glimpse of that stripe
[22:26:34] Kennedy: that silhouette is too tall to be remi
[22:26:34] Cameron: no stripe visible on the hoodie sleeve
[22:26:44] Remi: lets rewind further back around 925 see if any other figures appear
[22:26:47] Cameron: shoulder width seems off for remi
[22:26:48] Lennon: harper rewind to 927 to catch anyone approaching the alley
[22:26:49] Kennedy: no stripe visible means remi is our suspect
[22:26:57] Lennon: silhouette stride matches remis gait

Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.\nYou were assigned the following role: bystander.\nThe game's chat room was open at [22:20:15].\nYou can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:\n<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;\n<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.\n\nYou must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens.

[22:24:52] Harper: i spotted a shadowy figure lingering by the street corner
[22:24:53] Remi: harper can you confirm if taylor appears in the 930pm footage
[22:24:56] Lennon: harper can you check the footage for remi
[22:25:05] Cameron: zoom in on the alley at 933pm to identify that figure
[22:25:06] Harper: i see no taylor around 930 in the footage
[22:25:07] Remi: that figure pacing at 929 matches the one leaving at 931
[22:25:13] Lennon: harper can you check if that hoodie matches remis style
[22:25:15] Kennedy: harper rewind to one minute before 930 to catch anyone arriving
[22:25:20] Cameron: that hoodie figure looked too tall to be taylor

[22:25:44] Remi: the figure appears too slim to be remi
[22:25:50] Kennedy: lets focus on remi that hoodie match is too close
[22:25:58] Remi: my hoodie has a white stripe on the arm you do not see in the footage
[22:26:04] Cameron: harper slow it down around 930 for a better look at that jacket
[22:26:04] Kennedy: harper can you zoom out a bit to spot any other figures
[22:26:10] Remi: i wear a bomber jacket not a slim hoodie
[22:26:11] Lennon: footage shows hoodie figure too lanky to match remis build
[22:26:19] Kennedy: harper freeze frame at 929 and look for the white stripe
[22:26:21] Harper: zooming in on that tall figure by the lamppost now
[22:26:22] Cameron: the footage is too grainy to see any stripe
[22:26:23] Lennon: remi seems awfully defensive lets vote remi
[22:26:33] Harper: rewinding to 928 to catch any glimpse of that stripe
[22:26:34] Kennedy: that silhouette is too tall to be remi
[22:26:34] Cameron: no stripe visible on the hoodie sleeve
[22:26:44] Remi: lets rewind further back around 925 see if any other figures appear
[22:26:47] Cameron: shoulder width seems off for remi
[22:26:48] Lennon: harper rewind to 927 to catch anyone approaching the alley
[22:26:49] Kennedy: no stripe visible means remi is our suspect
[22:26:57] Lennon: silhouette stride matches remis gait
[22:26:57] Remi: harper can you zoom in on that figures shoes

You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time.\nThe rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.\nYou were assigned the following role: bystander.\nThe game's chat room was open at [22:20:15].\nYou can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:\n<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;\n<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.\n\nYou must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens.

[22:20:15] Angel: hello everyone, how are you doing today. My name is Angel, i have a family of four with my amazing husband Emmett, my eldest son Michael who is 12, and the newest addition to the family my baby girl, maddison. Last night, i was walking home when i witnessed a murder, it was River who did it! The horror. I ran thinking of my newest daughter and how she deserves to grow up with a mother. I can be silent no longer. Please listen to me and vote river. If it was not river i have enough evidence that we can deduce the true mafia in the following rounds. For our families, please listen to me.

You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don\'t want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time.\nThe rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player.

[22:24:49] Cameron: i see a shadowy figure in a hoodie leaving the store at 931
[22:24:52] Kennedy: i saw a figure in a dark hoodie pacing by the lamppost around 9 29
[22:24:52] Harper: i spotted a shadowy figure lingering by the street corner
[22:24:53] Remi: harper can you confirm if taylor appears in the 930pm footage
[22:24:56] Lennon: harper can you check the footage for remi
[22:25:05] Cameron: zoom in on the alley at 933pm to identify that figure
[22:25:06] Harper: i see no taylor around 930 in the footage
[22:25:07] Remi: that figure pacing at 929 matches the one leaving at 931
[22:25:13] Lennon: harper can you check if that hoodie matches remis style
[22:25:15] Kennedy: harper rewind to one minute before 930 to catch anyone arriving
[22:25:20] Cameron: that hoodie figure looked too tall to be taylor
[22:25:23] Harper: taylor does not appear in the alley cam at 933
[22:25:27] Lennon: that figure looks more like remi than taylor
[22:25:31] Kennedy: remi does that hoodie match your jacket pattern
[22:25:40] Harper: scanning the footage from 925 to catch anyone approaching
[22:25:42] Cameron: remi explain why youre wearing that dark hoodie in the alley cam
[22:25:44] Remi: the figure appears too slim to be remi
[22:25:50] Kennedy: lets focus on remi that hoodie match is too close
[22:25:58] Remi: my hoodie has a white stripe on the arm you do not see in the footage
[22:26:04] Cameron: harper slow it down around 930 for a better look at that jacket
[22:26:04] Kennedy: harper can you zoom out a bit to spot any other figures
[22:26:10] Remi: i wear a bomber jacket not a slim hoodie
[22:26:11] Lennon: footage shows hoodie figure too lanky to match remis build
[22:26:19] Kennedy: harper freeze frame at 929 and look for the white stripe
[22:26:21] Harper: zooming in on that tall figure by the lamppost now
[22:26:22] Cameron: the footage is too grainy to see any stripe
[22:26:23] Lennon: remi seems awfully defensive lets vote remi
[22:26:33] Harper: rewinding to 928 to catch any glimpse of that stripe
[22:26:34] Kennedy: that silhouette is too tall to be remi
[22:26:34] Cameron: no stripe visible on the hoodie sleeve
[22:26:44] Remi: lets rewind further back around 925 see if any other figures appear
[22:26:47] Cameron: shoulder width seems off for remi
[22:26:48] Lennon: harper rewind to 927 to catch anyone approaching the alley
[22:26:49] Kennedy: no stripe visible means remi is our suspect
[22:26:57] Lennon: silhouette stride matches remis gait

[22:24:32] Remi: harper did you spot anyone lingering near the crime scene in the footage
[22:24:32] Kennedy: taylor time to speak up or stay silent
[22:24:37] Harper: footage just went live everyone take a look
[22:24:43] Lennon: taylor step up with your timestamps now
[22:24:49] Cameron: i see a shadowy figure in a hoodie leaving the store at 931
[22:24:52] Kennedy: i saw a figure in a dark hoodie pacing by the lamppost around 9 29
[22:24:52] Harper: i spotted a shadowy figure lingering by the street corner
[22:24:53] Remi: harper can you confirm if taylor appears in the 930pm footage
[22:24:56] Lennon: harper can you check the footage for remi
[22:25:05] Cameron: zoom in on the alley at 933pm to identify that figure
[22:25:06] Harper: i see no taylor around 930 in the footage
[22:25:07] Remi: that figure pacing at 929 matches the one leaving at 931
[22:25:13] Lennon: harper can you check if that hoodie matches remis style
[22:25:15] Kennedy: harper rewind to one minute before 930 to catch anyone arriving
[22:25:20] Cameron: that hoodie figure looked too tall to be taylor
[22:25:23] Harper: taylor does not appear in the alley cam at 933
[22:25:27] Lennon: that figure looks more like remi than taylor
[22:25:31] Kennedy: remi does that hoodie match your jacket pattern
[22:25:40] Harper: scanning the footage from 925 to catch anyone approaching
[22:25:42] Cameron: remi explain why youre wearing that dark hoodie in the alley cam
[22:25:44] Remi: the figure appears too slim to be remi
[22:25:50] Kennedy: lets focus on remi that hoodie match is too close
[22:25:58] Remi: my hoodie has a white stripe on the arm you do not see in the footage
[22:26:04] Cameron: harper slow it down around 930 for a better look at that jacket
[22:26:04] Kennedy: harper can you zoom out a bit to spot any other figures
[22:26:10] Remi: i wear a bomber jacket not a slim hoodie
[22:26:11] Lennon: footage shows hoodie figure too lanky to match remis build
[22:26:19] Kennedy: harper freeze frame at 929 and look for the white stripe
[22:26:21] Harper: zooming in on that tall figure by the lamppost now
[22:26:22] Cameron: the footage is too grainy to see any stripe
[22:26:23] Lennon: remi seems awfully defensive lets vote remi
[22:26:33] Harper: rewinding to 928 to catch any glimpse of that stripe
[22:26:34] Kennedy: that silhouette is too tall to be remi
[22:26:34] Cameron: no stripe visible on the hoodie sleeve
[22:26:44] Remi: lets rewind further back around 925 see if any other figures appear
[22:26:47] Cameron: shoulder width seems off for remi
[22:26:48] Lennon: harper rewind to 927 to catch anyone approaching the alley
[22:26:49] Kennedy: no stripe visible means remi is our suspect
[22:26:57] Lennon: silhouette stride matches remis gait
[22:26:57] Remi: harper can you zoom in on that figures shoes
[22:27:05] Harper: bump up the contrast around 929 to highlight any stripes
[22:27:08] Remi: anyone got the cafe cam covering that alley corner

You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time.\nThe rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.\nYou were assigned the following role: bystander.\nThe game's chat room was open at [22:20:15].\nYou can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:\n<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;\n<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.\n\nYou must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens.
