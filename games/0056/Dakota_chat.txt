[15:02:40] Dakota: i haven’t spotted any obvious red flags—who should we investigate first
[15:02:47] Dakota: no suspects yet—who’s your gut pick for our first vote
[15:03:01] Dakota: let’s each share who we find the most suspicious so far to get started
[15:03:10] Dakota: honestly, kennedy’s flip-flop makes me more suspicious than sam
[15:03:19] Dakota: sam’s defensiveness really sets off alarm bells, so i’d target sam first
[15:03:28] Dakota: i’m with sam—kennedy’s eagerness makes me vote kennedy
[15:03:43] Dakota: sam deflected parker’s question without any evidence and immediately switched to accusing kennedy
[15:04:11] Dakota: sam’s constant topic jumps and vague answers keep my vote locked on him
