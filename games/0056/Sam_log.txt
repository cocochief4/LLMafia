Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

[15:03:30] Kennedy: dakota, what specifically about sam’s comments is making you suspicious
[15:03:35] Parker: sam keeps switching topics when pressed for specifics, which is a red flag
[15:03:43] Dakota: sam deflected parker’s question without any evidence and immediately switched to accusing kennedy
[15:03:44] Parker: i’m voting sam for now
[15:04:05] Sam: parker, can you give a concrete example of me switching topics
[15:04:08] Kennedy: sam, can you explain why you abruptly switched from deflecting parker’s question to accusing kennedy

You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time.\nThe rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.\nYou were assigned the following role: bystander.\nThe game's chat room was open at [15:02:34].\nThe other players in the game are:\n\n\n\n\nThe other players that have not been eliminated yet are:\n\n\n\n\n"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "The current time is [15:04:34].\nHere is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:\n[15:02:34] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.\n[15:02:39] Parker: good luck everyone—let’s have fun\n[15:02:40] Sam: anyone suspicious yet\n[15:02:40] Dakota: i haven’t spotted any obvious red flags—who should we investigate first\n[15:02:41] Kennedy: hey everyone, let’s kick this off and catch the mafia\n[15:02:44] Sam: alright everyone—any early suspicions\n[15:02:45] Parker: any initial suspicions on who might be mafia\n[15:02:47] Dakota: no suspects yet—who’s your gut pick for our first vote\n[15:02:49] Kennedy: sam—what exactly made you suspicious\n[15:02:53] Parker: does anyone else think kennedy’s eagerness is a bit suspicious\n[15:02:56] Sam: i noticed your strong push for an early vote, kennedy, which strikes me as a bit off\n[15:02:58] Kennedy: i’m suspicious of sam—thoughts\n[15:03:01] Dakota: let’s each share who we find the most suspicious so far to get started\n[15:03:07] Sam: what evidence do you have against me, kennedy\n[15:03:10] Parker: i’m suspicious of sam’s defensiveness—it feels like deflection\n[15:03:10] Dakota: honestly, kennedy’s flip-flop makes me more suspicious than sam\n[15:03:12] Kennedy: dakota, you’ve stayed quiet—do you find anything suspicious about sam or parker\n[15:03:17] Sam: my gut pick is kennedy—who’s with me\n[15:03:19] Dakota: sam’s defensiveness really sets off alarm bells, so i’d target sam first\n[15:03:22] Kennedy: parker, what exactly about sam’s defensiveness feels like deflection\n[15:03:28] Dakota: i’m with sam—kennedy’s eagerness makes me vote kennedy\n[15:03:28] Sam: parker, who are you voting for right now\n[15:03:30] Kennedy: dakota, what specifically about sam’s comments is making you suspicious\n[15:03:35] Parker: sam keeps switching topics when pressed for specifics, which is a red flag\n[15:03:43] Dakota: sam deflected parker’s question without any evidence and immediately switched to accusing kennedy\n[15:03:44] Parker: i’m voting sam for now\n[15:04:05] Sam: parker, can you give a concrete example of me switching topics\n[15:04:08] Kennedy: sam, can you explain why you abruptly switched from deflecting parker’s question to accusing kennedy\n[15:04:11] Dakota: sam’s constant topic jumps and vague answers keep my vote locked on him\n[15:04:15] Parker: for example, when dakota asked what evidence you had you immediately shifted to accusing kennedy instead of answering\n[15:04:18] Sam: i asked parker to back up his claim, then shifted focus to kennedy’s abrupt accusations\n[15:04:25] Sam: kennedy’s rush to vote screams mafia tactics more than my defensiveness ever could\n[15:04:34] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote!
