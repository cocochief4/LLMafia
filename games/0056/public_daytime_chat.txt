[15:02:39] Parker: good luck everyone—let’s have fun
[15:02:40] Sam: anyone suspicious yet
[15:02:40] Dakota: i haven’t spotted any obvious red flags—who should we investigate first
[15:02:41] Kennedy: hey everyone, let’s kick this off and catch the mafia
[15:02:44] Sam: alright everyone—any early suspicions
[15:02:45] Parker: any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[15:02:47] Dakota: no suspects yet—who’s your gut pick for our first vote
[15:02:49] Kennedy: sam—what exactly made you suspicious
[15:02:53] Parker: does anyone else think kennedy’s eagerness is a bit suspicious
[15:02:56] Sam: i noticed your strong push for an early vote, kennedy, which strikes me as a bit off
[15:02:58] Kennedy: i’m suspicious of sam—thoughts
[15:03:01] Dakota: let’s each share who we find the most suspicious so far to get started
[15:03:07] Sam: what evidence do you have against me, kennedy
[15:03:10] Parker: i’m suspicious of sam’s defensiveness—it feels like deflection
[15:03:10] Dakota: honestly, kennedy’s flip-flop makes me more suspicious than sam
[15:03:12] Kennedy: dakota, you’ve stayed quiet—do you find anything suspicious about sam or parker
[15:03:17] Sam: my gut pick is kennedy—who’s with me
[15:03:19] Dakota: sam’s defensiveness really sets off alarm bells, so i’d target sam first
[15:03:22] Kennedy: parker, what exactly about sam’s defensiveness feels like deflection
[15:03:28] Dakota: i’m with sam—kennedy’s eagerness makes me vote kennedy
[15:03:28] Sam: parker, who are you voting for right now
[15:03:30] Kennedy: dakota, what specifically about sam’s comments is making you suspicious
[15:03:35] Parker: sam keeps switching topics when pressed for specifics, which is a red flag
[15:03:43] Dakota: sam deflected parker’s question without any evidence and immediately switched to accusing kennedy
[15:03:44] Parker: i’m voting sam for now
[15:04:05] Sam: parker, can you give a concrete example of me switching topics
[15:04:08] Kennedy: sam, can you explain why you abruptly switched from deflecting parker’s question to accusing kennedy
[15:04:11] Dakota: sam’s constant topic jumps and vague answers keep my vote locked on him
[15:04:15] Parker: for example, when dakota asked what evidence you had you immediately shifted to accusing kennedy instead of answering
[15:04:18] Sam: i asked parker to back up his claim, then shifted focus to kennedy’s abrupt accusations
[15:04:25] Sam: kennedy’s rush to vote screams mafia tactics more than my defensiveness ever could
[15:04:34] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

[15:04:45] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Sam
[15:04:47] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sam
[15:04:48] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sam
