[15:02:40] Sam: anyone suspicious yet
[15:02:44] Sam: alright everyone—any early suspicions
[15:02:56] Sam: i noticed your strong push for an early vote, kennedy, which strikes me as a bit off
[15:03:07] Sam: what evidence do you have against me, kennedy
[15:03:17] Sam: my gut pick is kennedy—who’s with me
[15:03:28] Sam: parker, who are you voting for right now
[15:04:05] Sam: parker, can you give a concrete example of me switching topics
[15:04:18] Sam: i asked parker to back up his claim, then shifted focus to kennedy’s abrupt accusations
[15:04:25] Sam: kennedy’s rush to vote screams mafia tactics more than my defensiveness ever could
