[16:22:03] Frankie: good morning everyone, ready to figure out who’s up to no good
[16:22:12] Frankie: i noticed ronny was pretty quiet last night—that seems a bit off
[16:22:22] Frankie: ari asking twice about last night’s behavior strikes me as odd
[16:22:40] Frankie: addison's eagerness to blame me feels like a deflection—maybe we should vote-test addison instead
[16:23:02] Frankie: he only spoke when defending himself—reactive silence doesn’t feel right
[16:23:15] Frankie: let’s vote-test addison and see who jumps to their defense
[16:23:24] Frankie: i’m fine testing ari—let’s see who jumps to their defense
[16:24:58] Frankie: emerson, you’ve been suspiciously silent after ronny’s exit—what’s your read on ari
[16:25:14] Frankie: emerson’s awfully quiet since that vote—makes me wonder what they’re planning
[16:25:25] Frankie: i flipped on addison because her eager deflections looked like a cover-up and i wanted to see who’d defend her
[16:25:48] Frankie: emerson’s sudden silence seems off—let’s vote-test her
[16:26:35] Frankie: i’m voting emerson—her defensive questions feel like a smokescreen
