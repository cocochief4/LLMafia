## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you can perform step-by-step reasoning. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to think before you respond.
 1. Perform your step-by-step reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

## CONTENT: Your name is Ari.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:21:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Addison 
 Emerson 
 Ronny 
 Frankie 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:

In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you can perform step-by-step reasoning. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to think before you respond.
 1. Perform your step-by-step reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

## CONTENT: Your name is Ari.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:21:54].

## CONTENT: Your name is Ari.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:21:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Addison 
 Emerson 
 Ronny 
 Frankie 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Addison 
 Emerson

In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you can perform step-by-step reasoning. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to think before you respond.
 1. Perform your step-by-step reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

## CONTENT: Your name is Ari.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

## CONTENT: Your name is Ari.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:21:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Addison (bystander)
 Emerson 
 Ronny (bystander)
 Frankie 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:

[16:22:17] Emerson: Taylor's silence is very suspicious
[16:22:21] Ronny: frankie’s quietness was odd—should we vote-test them first
[16:22:22] Frankie: ari asking twice about last night’s behavior strikes me as odd
[16:22:24] Addison: emerson jumped in before we’d shared any observations—felt a bit off to me

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

## CONTENT: Your name is Ari.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:21:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Addison (bystander)
 Emerson 
 Ronny (bystander)
 Frankie 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Emerson 
 Frankie

 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

## CONTENT: Your name is Ari.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:21:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Addison (bystander)
 Emerson 
 Ronny (bystander)
 Frankie 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:

[16:22:00] Ari: hey all, excited to play—any early suspicions
[16:22:01] Addison: anyone notice odd behavior last night that could point to the mafia
[16:22:03] Frankie: good morning everyone, ready to figure out who’s up to no good

[16:22:22] Frankie: ari asking twice about last night’s behavior strikes me as odd
[16:22:24] Addison: emerson jumped in before we’d shared any observations—felt a bit off to me

[16:21:54] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 1.5 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:22:00] Ari: hey all, excited to play—any early suspicions
[16:22:01] Addison: anyone notice odd behavior last night that could point to the mafia
[16:22:03] Frankie: good morning everyone, ready to figure out who’s up to no good
[16:22:03] Ronny: did anyone pick up on any strange behavior last night
[16:22:07] Emerson: Okay I'm ready to get started finding the mafia
[16:22:08] Ari: did anyone notice odd behavior last night
[16:22:10] Addison: no strong reads yet—frankie’s quietness makes me pause though
[16:22:12] Frankie: i noticed ronny was pretty quiet last night—that seems a bit off
[16:22:17] Emerson: Taylor's silence is very suspicious
[16:22:21] Ronny: frankie’s quietness was odd—should we vote-test them first
[16:22:22] Frankie: ari asking twice about last night’s behavior strikes me as odd
[16:22:24] Addison: emerson jumped in before we’d shared any observations—felt a bit off to me
[16:22:31] Ronny: frankie, what specifically about my quietness seemed off to you
[16:22:34] Ari: emerson who’s taylor
[16:22:35] Addison: let’s vote-test ari to see who backs them
[16:22:40] Frankie: addison's eagerness to blame me feels like a deflection—maybe we should vote-test addison instead
[16:22:42] Ronny: ari’s double questioning last night feels like a distraction tactic we should keep an eye on
[16:22:44] Addison: emerson, who did you mean by “taylor
[16:22:46] Emerson: I'm just sying, jordan is also very silent, not saying anytyhing

[16:23:00] Ari: emerson, who is this jordan you mentioned earlier
[16:23:02] Frankie: he only spoke when defending himself—reactive silence doesn’t feel right
[16:23:08] Ari: i’m voting for addison as a test—who else will join in
[16:23:08] Addison: i’m not comfortable being vote-tested—let’s stick with testing ari
[16:23:15] Frankie: let’s vote-test addison and see who jumps to their defense
[16:23:24] Frankie: i’m fine testing ari—let’s see who jumps to their defense

[16:24:58] Frankie: emerson, you’ve been suspiciously silent after ronny’s exit—what’s your read on ari
[16:25:11] Ari: frankie, what made you flip to vote addison so quickly yesterday
[16:25:14] Frankie: emerson’s awfully quiet since that vote—makes me wonder what they’re planning
[16:25:25] Frankie: i flipped on addison because her eager deflections looked like a cover-up and i wanted to see who’d defend her
[16:25:25] Ari: let’s vote-test frankie and see who jumps to their defense
[16:25:35] Emerson: Frankie you seem to be awfully agressive in accusing others
[16:25:48] Frankie: emerson’s sudden silence seems off—let’s vote-test her

Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

## CONTENT: Your name is Ari.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:21:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Addison (bystander)
 Emerson 
 Ronny (bystander)
 Frankie 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Emerson 
 Frankie 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you can perform step-by-step reasoning. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to think before you respond.
 1. Perform your step-by-step reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[16:22:40] Frankie: addison's eagerness to blame me feels like a deflection—maybe we should vote-test addison instead

[16:25:14] Frankie: emerson’s awfully quiet since that vote—makes me wonder what they’re planning
[16:25:25] Frankie: i flipped on addison because her eager deflections looked like a cover-up and i wanted to see who’d defend her

[16:25:49] Ari: emerson, thoughts on frankie’s quick flip
[16:26:00] Emerson: Why did you want to see who would defend her? there is only one mafia, even if she was mafia it wouldn't mean anything if anyone defended her or not
Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.

[16:22:24] Addison: emerson jumped in before we’d shared any observations—felt a bit off to me
[16:22:31] Ronny: frankie, what specifically about my quietness seemed off to you
[16:22:34] Ari: emerson who’s taylor
[16:22:35] Addison: let’s vote-test ari to see who backs them
[16:22:40] Frankie: addison's eagerness to blame me feels like a deflection—maybe we should vote-test addison instead
[16:22:42] Ronny: ari’s double questioning last night feels like a distraction tactic we should keep an eye on
[16:22:44] Addison: emerson, who did you mean by “taylor
[16:22:46] Emerson: I'm just sying, jordan is also very silent, not saying anytyhing
[16:22:48] Ari: i’m curious too—frankie, what exactly about ronny’s quietness felt off
[16:22:51] Ronny: i agree we should test addison first—who else backs that
[16:22:59] Emerson: I back you ronny, that is a good test vote
[16:23:00] Ari: emerson, who is this jordan you mentioned earlier
[16:23:02] Frankie: he only spoke when defending himself—reactive silence doesn’t feel right
[16:23:08] Ari: i’m voting for addison as a test—who else will join in
[16:23:08] Addison: i’m not comfortable being vote-tested—let’s stick with testing ari
[16:23:15] Frankie: let’s vote-test addison and see who jumps to their defense
[16:23:24] Frankie: i’m fine testing ari—let’s see who jumps to their defense

[16:24:58] Frankie: emerson, you’ve been suspiciously silent after ronny’s exit—what’s your read on ari
[16:25:11] Ari: frankie, what made you flip to vote addison so quickly yesterday
[16:25:14] Frankie: emerson’s awfully quiet since that vote—makes me wonder what they’re planning
[16:25:25] Frankie: i flipped on addison because her eager deflections looked like a cover-up and i wanted to see who’d defend her
[16:25:25] Ari: let’s vote-test frankie and see who jumps to their defense
[16:25:35] Emerson: Frankie you seem to be awfully agressive in accusing others
[16:25:48] Frankie: emerson’s sudden silence seems off—let’s vote-test her
[16:25:49] Ari: emerson, thoughts on frankie’s quick flip
[16:26:00] Emerson: Why did you want to see who would defend her? there is only one mafia, even if she was mafia it wouldn't mean anything if anyone defended her or not
