[16:22:00] Ari: hey all, excited to play—any early suspicions
[16:22:01] Addison: anyone notice odd behavior last night that could point to the mafia
[16:22:03] Frankie: good morning everyone, ready to figure out who’s up to no good
[16:22:03] Ronny: did anyone pick up on any strange behavior last night
[16:22:07] Emerson: Okay I'm ready to get started finding the mafia
[16:22:08] Ari: did anyone notice odd behavior last night
[16:22:10] Addison: no strong reads yet—frankie’s quietness makes me pause though
[16:22:12] Frankie: i noticed ronny was pretty quiet last night—that seems a bit off
[16:22:17] Emerson: Taylor's silence is very suspicious
[16:22:21] Ronny: frankie’s quietness was odd—should we vote-test them first
[16:22:22] Frankie: ari asking twice about last night’s behavior strikes me as odd
[16:22:24] Addison: emerson jumped in before we’d shared any observations—felt a bit off to me
[16:22:31] Ronny: frankie, what specifically about my quietness seemed off to you
[16:22:34] Ari: emerson who’s taylor
[16:22:35] Addison: let’s vote-test ari to see who backs them
[16:22:40] Frankie: addison's eagerness to blame me feels like a deflection—maybe we should vote-test addison instead
[16:22:42] Ronny: ari’s double questioning last night feels like a distraction tactic we should keep an eye on
[16:22:44] Addison: emerson, who did you mean by “taylor
[16:22:46] Emerson: I'm just sying, jordan is also very silent, not saying anytyhing
[16:22:48] Ari: i’m curious too—frankie, what exactly about ronny’s quietness felt off
[16:22:51] Ronny: i agree we should test addison first—who else backs that
[16:22:59] Emerson: I back you ronny, that is a good test vote
[16:23:00] Ari: emerson, who is this jordan you mentioned earlier
[16:23:02] Frankie: he only spoke when defending himself—reactive silence doesn’t feel right
[16:23:08] Ari: i’m voting for addison as a test—who else will join in
[16:23:08] Addison: i’m not comfortable being vote-tested—let’s stick with testing ari
[16:23:15] Frankie: let’s vote-test addison and see who jumps to their defense
[16:23:24] Frankie: i’m fine testing ari—let’s see who jumps to their defense
[16:23:24] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

[16:24:20] Game-Manager: Emerson voted for Addison
[16:24:58] Frankie: emerson, you’ve been suspiciously silent after ronny’s exit—what’s your read on ari
[16:25:11] Ari: frankie, what made you flip to vote addison so quickly yesterday
[16:25:14] Frankie: emerson’s awfully quiet since that vote—makes me wonder what they’re planning
[16:25:25] Frankie: i flipped on addison because her eager deflections looked like a cover-up and i wanted to see who’d defend her
[16:25:25] Ari: let’s vote-test frankie and see who jumps to their defense
[16:25:35] Emerson: Frankie you seem to be awfully agressive in accusing others
[16:25:48] Frankie: emerson’s sudden silence seems off—let’s vote-test her
[16:25:49] Ari: emerson, thoughts on frankie’s quick flip
[16:26:00] Emerson: Why did you want to see who would defend her? there is only one mafia, even if she was mafia it wouldn't mean anything if anyone defended her or not
[16:26:03] Ari: i’m on board—let’s vote-test emerson
[16:26:07] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
