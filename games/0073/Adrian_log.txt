## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney 
 Parker 
 Drew 
 Finley 
 Tyler

 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney 
 Parker 
 Drew 
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Sidney 
 Parker 
 Drew 
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney 
 Parker 
 Drew 
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Sidney 
 Parker 
 Drew 
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame

[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring

[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney 
 Parker 
 Drew 
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Sidney 
 Parker 
 Drew 
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning

[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect

[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney 
 Parker 
 Drew

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user.

[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker

[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney 
 Parker 
 Drew 
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney 
 Parker 
 Drew 
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:

 Parker 
 Drew

[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection

[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him

[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself

[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker

[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up

Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney 
 Parker

[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander.

The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.

[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney 
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Sidney 
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response.

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:

[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney 
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Sidney 
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him

[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew

[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd

[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander

[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections

[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far

[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night

[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].

[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away

[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were

[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney 
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Sidney 
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker

[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:

[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:38:05] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[17:38:07] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Drew

[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney 
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Sidney 
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>.

[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away

[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go

[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient

[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney 
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Sidney 
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported

[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia

[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill

[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote

[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney 
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Sidney 
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away

[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient

[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:

 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away

[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney 
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Sidney 
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy

[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander

[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:38:05] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[17:38:07] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Drew
[17:38:10] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[17:38:11] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Drew
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney 
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Sidney 
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy

[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection

[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew

[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:

[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him

[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:38:05] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[17:38:07] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Drew
[17:38:10] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[17:38:11] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Drew
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney 
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Sidney 
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy

[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame

[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient

[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker

[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].

The last messages are Sidney accusing Kennedy of not explaining her night action; Adrian needs to push Sidney for specifics rather than making another generic ask of Kennedy.
Adrian's style: questioning others, asking for specifics.
Ensure one short sentence, not repeating previous phrasing.
>>> 
Sidney, besides the night-action claim, what specific behavior makes you suspect Kennedy?

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:38:05] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[17:38:07] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Drew

[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker

[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote

[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Finley 
 Tyler

[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:38:05] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[17:38:07] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Drew
[17:38:10] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker

[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney was voted out. Their role was mafia
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[17:42:12] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[17:42:20] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sidney

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Finley 
 Tyler

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew

[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney was voted out. Their role was mafia
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me

[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.

[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney was voted out. Their role was mafia
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Finley 
 Tyler

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>.

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker

[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty

[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker

[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney was voted out. Their role was mafia
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:

[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far

[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth

[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote

[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words

We need to add a very short, one-sentence chat message as Adrian, following Tyler’s “looks like we’ve flushed out all the mafia—nice work everyone.”
It must be relevant: only three players remain (Adrian, Finley, Tyler), Tyler is the last mafia.
Adrian’s style: direct questions, calls for specifics.
We shouldn’t repeat past lines. We should subtly question Tyler’s certainty.
A concise question about Tyler’s premature celebration after another bystander was killed will sow doubt.

Tyler, why so quick to celebrate after losing another bystander?

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:38:05] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[17:38:07] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Drew
[17:38:10] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[17:38:11] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Drew
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney was voted out. Their role was mafia
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[17:42:12] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[17:42:20] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sidney
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:59] Tyler: looks like we’ve flushed out all the mafia—nice work everyone
[17:43:07] Adrian: given that kennedy was the night kill, which of us seems the likeliest mafia now
[17:43:14] Finley: adrian’s eagerness to lead the charge without any new proof feels suspicious
[17:43:14] Tyler: looks like we’ve cleaned house—no mafia left
[17:43:24] Finley: tyler’s quick self-congratulations make me wonder if he’s deflecting

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Finley 
 Tyler

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>.

[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:38:05] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[17:38:07] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Drew
[17:38:10] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[17:38:11] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Drew
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney was voted out. Their role was mafia
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[17:42:12] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[17:42:20] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sidney
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:59] Tyler: looks like we’ve flushed out all the mafia—nice work everyone
[17:43:07] Adrian: given that kennedy was the night kill, which of us seems the likeliest mafia now
[17:43:14] Finley: adrian’s eagerness to lead the charge without any new proof feels suspicious
[17:43:14] Tyler: looks like we’ve cleaned house—no mafia left
[17:43:24] Finley: tyler’s quick self-congratulations make me wonder if he’s deflecting

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:

[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander

[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney was voted out. Their role was mafia
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!

[17:42:20] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sidney

[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:59] Tyler: looks like we’ve flushed out all the mafia—nice work everyone
[17:43:07] Adrian: given that kennedy was the night kill, which of us seems the likeliest mafia now
[17:43:14] Finley: adrian’s eagerness to lead the charge without any new proof feels suspicious
[17:43:14] Tyler: looks like we’ve cleaned house—no mafia left
[17:43:24] Finley: tyler’s quick self-congratulations make me wonder if he’s deflecting

[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag

[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney was voted out. Their role was mafia
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[17:42:12] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[17:42:20] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sidney
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:59] Tyler: looks like we’ve flushed out all the mafia—nice work everyone
[17:43:07] Adrian: given that kennedy was the night kill, which of us seems the likeliest mafia now
[17:43:14] Finley: adrian’s eagerness to lead the charge without any new proof feels suspicious
[17:43:14] Tyler: looks like we’ve cleaned house—no mafia left
[17:43:24] Finley: tyler’s quick self-congratulations make me wonder if he’s deflecting
[17:43:28] Adrian: tyler, why so quick to celebrate after losing another bystander
[17:43:29] Tyler: adrian, what made you rule me out immediately and zero in on finley
[17:43:41] Finley: tyler’s confident “we’ve cleaned house” claim feels oddly convenient

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Finley 
 Tyler

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:38:05] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[17:38:07] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Drew
[17:38:10] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[17:38:11] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Drew
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:38:05] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[17:38:07] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Drew
[17:38:10] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[17:38:11] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Drew
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney was voted out. Their role was mafia
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[17:42:12] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[17:42:20] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sidney
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:59] Tyler: looks like we’ve flushed out all the mafia—nice work everyone
[17:43:07] Adrian: given that kennedy was the night kill, which of us seems the likeliest mafia now
[17:43:14] Finley: adrian’s eagerness to lead the charge without any new proof feels suspicious
[17:43:14] Tyler: looks like we’ve cleaned house—no mafia left
[17:43:24] Finley: tyler’s quick self-congratulations make me wonder if he’s deflecting
[17:43:28] Adrian: tyler, why so quick to celebrate after losing another bystander
[17:43:29] Tyler: adrian, what made you rule me out immediately and zero in on finley
[17:43:41] Finley: tyler’s confident “we’ve cleaned house” claim feels oddly convenient

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:38:05] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[17:38:07] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Drew
[17:38:10] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker

[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney was voted out. Their role was mafia
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[17:42:12] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[17:42:20] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sidney
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:59] Tyler: looks like we’ve flushed out all the mafia—nice work everyone
[17:43:07] Adrian: given that kennedy was the night kill, which of us seems the likeliest mafia now
[17:43:14] Finley: adrian’s eagerness to lead the charge without any new proof feels suspicious
[17:43:14] Tyler: looks like we’ve cleaned house—no mafia left
[17:43:24] Finley: tyler’s quick self-congratulations make me wonder if he’s deflecting
[17:43:28] Adrian: tyler, why so quick to celebrate after losing another bystander
[17:43:29] Tyler: adrian, what made you rule me out immediately and zero in on finley
[17:43:41] Finley: tyler’s confident “we’ve cleaned house” claim feels oddly convenient
[17:43:46] Adrian: tyler, what evidence backs up your claim that there’s no mafia left
[17:44:03] Finley: adrian, you dismissed tyler without a shred of evidence—what exactly convinced you
[17:44:07] Tyler: i see your point, but my votes were driven by behaviors, not convenience

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Finley 
 Tyler

[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney was voted out. Their role was mafia
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[17:42:12] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[17:42:20] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sidney
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:59] Tyler: looks like we’ve flushed out all the mafia—nice work everyone
[17:43:07] Adrian: given that kennedy was the night kill, which of us seems the likeliest mafia now
[17:43:14] Finley: adrian’s eagerness to lead the charge without any new proof feels suspicious
[17:43:14] Tyler: looks like we’ve cleaned house—no mafia left
[17:43:24] Finley: tyler’s quick self-congratulations make me wonder if he’s deflecting
[17:43:28] Adrian: tyler, why so quick to celebrate after losing another bystander
[17:43:29] Tyler: adrian, what made you rule me out immediately and zero in on finley
[17:43:41] Finley: tyler’s confident “we’ve cleaned house” claim feels oddly convenient
[17:43:46] Adrian: tyler, what evidence backs up your claim that there’s no mafia left
[17:44:03] Finley: adrian, you dismissed tyler without a shred of evidence—what exactly convinced you
[17:44:07] Tyler: i see your point, but my votes were driven by behaviors, not convenience

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker

[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient

[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)

[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.

[17:38:07] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Drew
[17:38:10] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[17:38:11] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Drew
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney was voted out. Their role was mafia
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[17:42:12] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[17:42:20] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sidney
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:59] Tyler: looks like we’ve flushed out all the mafia—nice work everyone
[17:43:07] Adrian: given that kennedy was the night kill, which of us seems the likeliest mafia now
[17:43:14] Finley: adrian’s eagerness to lead the charge without any new proof feels suspicious
[17:43:14] Tyler: looks like we’ve cleaned house—no mafia left
[17:43:24] Finley: tyler’s quick self-congratulations make me wonder if he’s deflecting
[17:43:28] Adrian: tyler, why so quick to celebrate after losing another bystander
[17:43:29] Tyler: adrian, what made you rule me out immediately and zero in on finley
[17:43:41] Finley: tyler’s confident “we’ve cleaned house” claim feels oddly convenient
[17:43:46] Adrian: tyler, what evidence backs up your claim that there’s no mafia left
[17:44:03] Finley: adrian, you dismissed tyler without a shred of evidence—what exactly convinced you
[17:44:07] Tyler: i see your point, but my votes were driven by behaviors, not convenience

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night

[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious

[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney was voted out. Their role was mafia
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[17:42:12] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[17:42:20] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sidney
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:59] Tyler: looks like we’ve flushed out all the mafia—nice work everyone
[17:43:07] Adrian: given that kennedy was the night kill, which of us seems the likeliest mafia now
[17:43:14] Finley: adrian’s eagerness to lead the charge without any new proof feels suspicious
[17:43:14] Tyler: looks like we’ve cleaned house—no mafia left
[17:43:24] Finley: tyler’s quick self-congratulations make me wonder if he’s deflecting
[17:43:28] Adrian: tyler, why so quick to celebrate after losing another bystander
[17:43:29] Tyler: adrian, what made you rule me out immediately and zero in on finley
[17:43:41] Finley: tyler’s confident “we’ve cleaned house” claim feels oddly convenient
[17:43:46] Adrian: tyler, what evidence backs up your claim that there’s no mafia left
[17:44:03] Finley: adrian, you dismissed tyler without a shred of evidence—what exactly convinced you
[17:44:07] Tyler: i see your point, but my votes were driven by behaviors, not convenience
[17:44:08] Adrian: tyler, why so confident we’re mafia-free when the killer is still among us
[17:44:31] Tyler: with sidney and kennedy exposed, there’s no mafia left among us

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Finley 
 Tyler

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:38:05] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[17:38:07] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Drew
[17:38:10] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[17:38:11] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Drew
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander

[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney was voted out. Their role was mafia
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[17:42:12] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[17:42:20] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sidney
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:59] Tyler: looks like we’ve flushed out all the mafia—nice work everyone
[17:43:07] Adrian: given that kennedy was the night kill, which of us seems the likeliest mafia now
[17:43:14] Finley: adrian’s eagerness to lead the charge without any new proof feels suspicious
[17:43:14] Tyler: looks like we’ve cleaned house—no mafia left
[17:43:24] Finley: tyler’s quick self-congratulations make me wonder if he’s deflecting
[17:43:28] Adrian: tyler, why so quick to celebrate after losing another bystander
[17:43:29] Tyler: adrian, what made you rule me out immediately and zero in on finley
[17:43:41] Finley: tyler’s confident “we’ve cleaned house” claim feels oddly convenient
[17:43:46] Adrian: tyler, what evidence backs up your claim that there’s no mafia left
[17:44:03] Finley: adrian, you dismissed tyler without a shred of evidence—what exactly convinced you
[17:44:07] Tyler: i see your point, but my votes were driven by behaviors, not convenience
[17:44:08] Adrian: tyler, why so confident we’re mafia-free when the killer is still among us
[17:44:31] Tyler: with sidney and kennedy exposed, there’s no mafia left among us

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go

[17:43:28] Adrian: tyler, why so quick to celebrate after losing another bystander
[17:43:29] Tyler: adrian, what made you rule me out immediately and zero in on finley
[17:43:41] Finley: tyler’s confident “we’ve cleaned house” claim feels oddly convenient
[17:43:46] Adrian: tyler, what evidence backs up your claim that there’s no mafia left
[17:44:03] Finley: adrian, you dismissed tyler without a shred of evidence—what exactly convinced you
[17:44:07] Tyler: i see your point, but my votes were driven by behaviors, not convenience
[17:44:08] Adrian: tyler, why so confident we’re mafia-free when the killer is still among us
[17:44:31] Tyler: with sidney and kennedy exposed, there’s no mafia left among us

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:38:05] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[17:38:07] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Drew
[17:38:10] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[17:38:11] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Drew
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney was voted out. Their role was mafia
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[17:42:12] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[17:42:20] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sidney
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:59] Tyler: looks like we’ve flushed out all the mafia—nice work everyone
[17:43:07] Adrian: given that kennedy was the night kill, which of us seems the likeliest mafia now
[17:43:14] Finley: adrian’s eagerness to lead the charge without any new proof feels suspicious
[17:43:14] Tyler: looks like we’ve cleaned house—no mafia left
[17:43:24] Finley: tyler’s quick self-congratulations make me wonder if he’s deflecting
[17:43:28] Adrian: tyler, why so quick to celebrate after losing another bystander
[17:43:29] Tyler: adrian, what made you rule me out immediately and zero in on finley
[17:43:41] Finley: tyler’s confident “we’ve cleaned house” claim feels oddly convenient
[17:43:46] Adrian: tyler, what evidence backs up your claim that there’s no mafia left
[17:44:03] Finley: adrian, you dismissed tyler without a shred of evidence—what exactly convinced you
[17:44:07] Tyler: i see your point, but my votes were driven by behaviors, not convenience
[17:44:08] Adrian: tyler, why so confident we’re mafia-free when the killer is still among us
[17:44:31] Tyler: with sidney and kennedy exposed, there’s no mafia left among us
[17:44:39] Adrian: finley, what specific behavior made tyler’s quick celebration look like a deflection to you
[17:44:45] Tyler: adrian, what exactly about finley’s actions today makes her a bigger suspect than me
[17:44:50] Finley: tyler, your hasty celebration ignores your own silence on last night’s actions—what were you up to

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Finley 
 Tyler

[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:38:05] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[17:38:07] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Drew
[17:38:10] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[17:38:11] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Drew
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney was voted out. Their role was mafia
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[17:42:12] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[17:42:20] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sidney
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:59] Tyler: looks like we’ve flushed out all the mafia—nice work everyone
[17:43:07] Adrian: given that kennedy was the night kill, which of us seems the likeliest mafia now
[17:43:14] Finley: adrian’s eagerness to lead the charge without any new proof feels suspicious
[17:43:14] Tyler: looks like we’ve cleaned house—no mafia left
[17:43:24] Finley: tyler’s quick self-congratulations make me wonder if he’s deflecting
[17:43:28] Adrian: tyler, why so quick to celebrate after losing another bystander
[17:43:29] Tyler: adrian, what made you rule me out immediately and zero in on finley
[17:43:41] Finley: tyler’s confident “we’ve cleaned house” claim feels oddly convenient
[17:43:46] Adrian: tyler, what evidence backs up your claim that there’s no mafia left
[17:44:03] Finley: adrian, you dismissed tyler without a shred of evidence—what exactly convinced you
[17:44:07] Tyler: i see your point, but my votes were driven by behaviors, not convenience
[17:44:08] Adrian: tyler, why so confident we’re mafia-free when the killer is still among us
[17:44:31] Tyler: with sidney and kennedy exposed, there’s no mafia left among us
[17:44:39] Adrian: finley, what specific behavior made tyler’s quick celebration look like a deflection to you
[17:44:45] Tyler: adrian, what exactly about finley’s actions today makes her a bigger suspect than me
[17:44:50] Finley: tyler, your hasty celebration ignores your own silence on last night’s actions—what were you up to

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away

[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet

[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia

[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].

 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)

 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:38:05] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[17:38:07] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Drew
[17:38:10] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[17:38:11] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Drew
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney was voted out. Their role was mafia
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[17:42:12] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[17:42:20] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sidney
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:59] Tyler: looks like we’ve flushed out all the mafia—nice work everyone
[17:43:07] Adrian: given that kennedy was the night kill, which of us seems the likeliest mafia now
[17:43:14] Finley: adrian’s eagerness to lead the charge without any new proof feels suspicious
[17:43:14] Tyler: looks like we’ve cleaned house—no mafia left
[17:43:24] Finley: tyler’s quick self-congratulations make me wonder if he’s deflecting
[17:43:28] Adrian: tyler, why so quick to celebrate after losing another bystander
[17:43:29] Tyler: adrian, what made you rule me out immediately and zero in on finley
[17:43:41] Finley: tyler’s confident “we’ve cleaned house” claim feels oddly convenient
[17:43:46] Adrian: tyler, what evidence backs up your claim that there’s no mafia left
[17:44:03] Finley: adrian, you dismissed tyler without a shred of evidence—what exactly convinced you
[17:44:07] Tyler: i see your point, but my votes were driven by behaviors, not convenience
[17:44:08] Adrian: tyler, why so confident we’re mafia-free when the killer is still among us
[17:44:31] Tyler: with sidney and kennedy exposed, there’s no mafia left among us
[17:44:39] Adrian: finley, what specific behavior made tyler’s quick celebration look like a deflection to you
[17:44:45] Tyler: adrian, what exactly about finley’s actions today makes her a bigger suspect than me
[17:44:50] Finley: tyler, your hasty celebration ignores your own silence on last night’s actions—what were you up to

[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney was voted out. Their role was mafia
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[17:42:12] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[17:42:20] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sidney
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:59] Tyler: looks like we’ve flushed out all the mafia—nice work everyone
[17:43:07] Adrian: given that kennedy was the night kill, which of us seems the likeliest mafia now
[17:43:14] Finley: adrian’s eagerness to lead the charge without any new proof feels suspicious
[17:43:14] Tyler: looks like we’ve cleaned house—no mafia left
[17:43:24] Finley: tyler’s quick self-congratulations make me wonder if he’s deflecting
[17:43:28] Adrian: tyler, why so quick to celebrate after losing another bystander
[17:43:29] Tyler: adrian, what made you rule me out immediately and zero in on finley
[17:43:41] Finley: tyler’s confident “we’ve cleaned house” claim feels oddly convenient
[17:43:46] Adrian: tyler, what evidence backs up your claim that there’s no mafia left
[17:44:03] Finley: adrian, you dismissed tyler without a shred of evidence—what exactly convinced you
[17:44:07] Tyler: i see your point, but my votes were driven by behaviors, not convenience
[17:44:08] Adrian: tyler, why so confident we’re mafia-free when the killer is still among us
[17:44:31] Tyler: with sidney and kennedy exposed, there’s no mafia left among us
[17:44:39] Adrian: finley, what specific behavior made tyler’s quick celebration look like a deflection to you
[17:44:45] Tyler: adrian, what exactly about finley’s actions today makes her a bigger suspect than me
[17:44:50] Finley: tyler, your hasty celebration ignores your own silence on last night’s actions—what were you up to
[17:44:58] Adrian: finley, what exact behavior convinces you tyler isn’t the mafia
[17:45:03] Tyler: i was reviewing vote patterns overnight, not hiding anything—why does my silence worry you
[17:45:07] Finley: tyler, your eagerness to wrap this up without revisiting kennedy’s dodged answers seems suspicious

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Finley 
 Tyler

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker

[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that

[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point

[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious

[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander

[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney was voted out. Their role was mafia
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[17:42:12] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[17:42:20] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sidney
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:59] Tyler: looks like we’ve flushed out all the mafia—nice work everyone
[17:43:07] Adrian: given that kennedy was the night kill, which of us seems the likeliest mafia now
[17:43:14] Finley: adrian’s eagerness to lead the charge without any new proof feels suspicious
[17:43:14] Tyler: looks like we’ve cleaned house—no mafia left
[17:43:24] Finley: tyler’s quick self-congratulations make me wonder if he’s deflecting
[17:43:28] Adrian: tyler, why so quick to celebrate after losing another bystander
[17:43:29] Tyler: adrian, what made you rule me out immediately and zero in on finley
[17:43:41] Finley: tyler’s confident “we’ve cleaned house” claim feels oddly convenient
[17:43:46] Adrian: tyler, what evidence backs up your claim that there’s no mafia left
[17:44:03] Finley: adrian, you dismissed tyler without a shred of evidence—what exactly convinced you
[17:44:07] Tyler: i see your point, but my votes were driven by behaviors, not convenience
[17:44:08] Adrian: tyler, why so confident we’re mafia-free when the killer is still among us
[17:44:31] Tyler: with sidney and kennedy exposed, there’s no mafia left among us
[17:44:39] Adrian: finley, what specific behavior made tyler’s quick celebration look like a deflection to you
[17:44:45] Tyler: adrian, what exactly about finley’s actions today makes her a bigger suspect than me
[17:44:50] Finley: tyler, your hasty celebration ignores your own silence on last night’s actions—what were you up to
[17:44:58] Adrian: finley, what exact behavior convinces you tyler isn’t the mafia
[17:45:03] Tyler: i was reviewing vote patterns overnight, not hiding anything—why does my silence worry you
[17:45:07] Finley: tyler, your eagerness to wrap this up without revisiting kennedy’s dodged answers seems suspicious

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:

[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney was voted out. Their role was mafia
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[17:42:12] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[17:42:20] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sidney
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:59] Tyler: looks like we’ve flushed out all the mafia—nice work everyone
[17:43:07] Adrian: given that kennedy was the night kill, which of us seems the likeliest mafia now
[17:43:14] Finley: adrian’s eagerness to lead the charge without any new proof feels suspicious
[17:43:14] Tyler: looks like we’ve cleaned house—no mafia left
[17:43:24] Finley: tyler’s quick self-congratulations make me wonder if he’s deflecting
[17:43:28] Adrian: tyler, why so quick to celebrate after losing another bystander
[17:43:29] Tyler: adrian, what made you rule me out immediately and zero in on finley
[17:43:41] Finley: tyler’s confident “we’ve cleaned house” claim feels oddly convenient
[17:43:46] Adrian: tyler, what evidence backs up your claim that there’s no mafia left
[17:44:03] Finley: adrian, you dismissed tyler without a shred of evidence—what exactly convinced you
[17:44:07] Tyler: i see your point, but my votes were driven by behaviors, not convenience
[17:44:08] Adrian: tyler, why so confident we’re mafia-free when the killer is still among us
[17:44:31] Tyler: with sidney and kennedy exposed, there’s no mafia left among us
[17:44:39] Adrian: finley, what specific behavior made tyler’s quick celebration look like a deflection to you
[17:44:45] Tyler: adrian, what exactly about finley’s actions today makes her a bigger suspect than me
[17:44:50] Finley: tyler, your hasty celebration ignores your own silence on last night’s actions—what were you up to
[17:44:58] Adrian: finley, what exact behavior convinces you tyler isn’t the mafia
[17:45:03] Tyler: i was reviewing vote patterns overnight, not hiding anything—why does my silence worry you
[17:45:07] Finley: tyler, your eagerness to wrap this up without revisiting kennedy’s dodged answers seems suspicious

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew

[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd

[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill

[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me

[17:45:13] Adrian: tyler, can you explain what you were doing last night instead of celebrating so eagerly this morning
[17:45:18] Finley: adrian, you’ve pressed tyler and me relentlessly but still haven’t said what you were doing last night—care to explain
[17:45:30] Tyler: i was reviewing vote timestamps overnight to spot any patterns before speaking up
[17:45:31] Finley: adrian, why so keen to grill tyler instead of sharing your own night alibi

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Finley 
 Tyler

[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:38:05] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[17:38:07] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Drew
[17:38:10] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[17:38:11] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Drew
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney was voted out. Their role was mafia
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[17:42:12] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[17:42:20] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sidney
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:59] Tyler: looks like we’ve flushed out all the mafia—nice work everyone
[17:43:07] Adrian: given that kennedy was the night kill, which of us seems the likeliest mafia now
[17:43:14] Finley: adrian’s eagerness to lead the charge without any new proof feels suspicious
[17:43:14] Tyler: looks like we’ve cleaned house—no mafia left
[17:43:24] Finley: tyler’s quick self-congratulations make me wonder if he’s deflecting
[17:43:28] Adrian: tyler, why so quick to celebrate after losing another bystander
[17:43:29] Tyler: adrian, what made you rule me out immediately and zero in on finley
[17:43:41] Finley: tyler’s confident “we’ve cleaned house” claim feels oddly convenient
[17:43:46] Adrian: tyler, what evidence backs up your claim that there’s no mafia left
[17:44:03] Finley: adrian, you dismissed tyler without a shred of evidence—what exactly convinced you
[17:44:07] Tyler: i see your point, but my votes were driven by behaviors, not convenience
[17:44:08] Adrian: tyler, why so confident we’re mafia-free when the killer is still among us
[17:44:31] Tyler: with sidney and kennedy exposed, there’s no mafia left among us
[17:44:39] Adrian: finley, what specific behavior made tyler’s quick celebration look like a deflection to you
[17:44:45] Tyler: adrian, what exactly about finley’s actions today makes her a bigger suspect than me
[17:44:50] Finley: tyler, your hasty celebration ignores your own silence on last night’s actions—what were you up to
[17:44:58] Adrian: finley, what exact behavior convinces you tyler isn’t the mafia
[17:45:03] Tyler: i was reviewing vote patterns overnight, not hiding anything—why does my silence worry you
[17:45:07] Finley: tyler, your eagerness to wrap this up without revisiting kennedy’s dodged answers seems suspicious
[17:45:13] Adrian: tyler, can you explain what you were doing last night instead of celebrating so eagerly this morning
[17:45:18] Finley: adrian, you’ve pressed tyler and me relentlessly but still haven’t said what you were doing last night—care to explain
[17:45:30] Tyler: i was reviewing vote timestamps overnight to spot any patterns before speaking up
[17:45:31] Finley: adrian, why so keen to grill tyler instead of sharing your own night alibi

[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney was voted out. Their role was mafia
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.

[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:59] Tyler: looks like we’ve flushed out all the mafia—nice work everyone
[17:43:07] Adrian: given that kennedy was the night kill, which of us seems the likeliest mafia now
[17:43:14] Finley: adrian’s eagerness to lead the charge without any new proof feels suspicious
[17:43:14] Tyler: looks like we’ve cleaned house—no mafia left
[17:43:24] Finley: tyler’s quick self-congratulations make me wonder if he’s deflecting
[17:43:28] Adrian: tyler, why so quick to celebrate after losing another bystander
[17:43:29] Tyler: adrian, what made you rule me out immediately and zero in on finley
[17:43:41] Finley: tyler’s confident “we’ve cleaned house” claim feels oddly convenient
[17:43:46] Adrian: tyler, what evidence backs up your claim that there’s no mafia left
[17:44:03] Finley: adrian, you dismissed tyler without a shred of evidence—what exactly convinced you
[17:44:07] Tyler: i see your point, but my votes were driven by behaviors, not convenience
[17:44:08] Adrian: tyler, why so confident we’re mafia-free when the killer is still among us
[17:44:31] Tyler: with sidney and kennedy exposed, there’s no mafia left among us
[17:44:39] Adrian: finley, what specific behavior made tyler’s quick celebration look like a deflection to you
[17:44:45] Tyler: adrian, what exactly about finley’s actions today makes her a bigger suspect than me
[17:44:50] Finley: tyler, your hasty celebration ignores your own silence on last night’s actions—what were you up to
[17:44:58] Adrian: finley, what exact behavior convinces you tyler isn’t the mafia
[17:45:03] Tyler: i was reviewing vote patterns overnight, not hiding anything—why does my silence worry you
[17:45:07] Finley: tyler, your eagerness to wrap this up without revisiting kennedy’s dodged answers seems suspicious
[17:45:13] Adrian: tyler, can you explain what you were doing last night instead of celebrating so eagerly this morning
[17:45:18] Finley: adrian, you’ve pressed tyler and me relentlessly but still haven’t said what you were doing last night—care to explain
[17:45:30] Tyler: i was reviewing vote timestamps overnight to spot any patterns before speaking up
[17:45:31] Finley: adrian, why so keen to grill tyler instead of sharing your own night alibi

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew

Finley just asked me to share my night alibi, so I need to provide a brief but plausible explanation of what I was doing last night to mirror how Tyler explained his alibi.
I’m Adrian, and up to now I’ve been pressing others for specifics but haven’t said what I did overnight.
I should now disclose that I also spent the night reviewing vote patterns to look for inconsistencies — one clear sentence is enough.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:38:05] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[17:38:07] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Drew
[17:38:10] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[17:38:11] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Drew
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney was voted out. Their role was mafia
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[17:42:12] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[17:42:20] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sidney
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:59] Tyler: looks like we’ve flushed out all the mafia—nice work everyone
[17:43:07] Adrian: given that kennedy was the night kill, which of us seems the likeliest mafia now
[17:43:14] Finley: adrian’s eagerness to lead the charge without any new proof feels suspicious
[17:43:14] Tyler: looks like we’ve cleaned house—no mafia left
[17:43:24] Finley: tyler’s quick self-congratulations make me wonder if he’s deflecting
[17:43:28] Adrian: tyler, why so quick to celebrate after losing another bystander
[17:43:29] Tyler: adrian, what made you rule me out immediately and zero in on finley
[17:43:41] Finley: tyler’s confident “we’ve cleaned house” claim feels oddly convenient
[17:43:46] Adrian: tyler, what evidence backs up your claim that there’s no mafia left
[17:44:03] Finley: adrian, you dismissed tyler without a shred of evidence—what exactly convinced you
[17:44:07] Tyler: i see your point, but my votes were driven by behaviors, not convenience
[17:44:08] Adrian: tyler, why so confident we’re mafia-free when the killer is still among us
[17:44:31] Tyler: with sidney and kennedy exposed, there’s no mafia left among us
[17:44:39] Adrian: finley, what specific behavior made tyler’s quick celebration look like a deflection to you
[17:44:45] Tyler: adrian, what exactly about finley’s actions today makes her a bigger suspect than me
[17:44:50] Finley: tyler, your hasty celebration ignores your own silence on last night’s actions—what were you up to
[17:44:58] Adrian: finley, what exact behavior convinces you tyler isn’t the mafia
[17:45:03] Tyler: i was reviewing vote patterns overnight, not hiding anything—why does my silence worry you
[17:45:07] Finley: tyler, your eagerness to wrap this up without revisiting kennedy’s dodged answers seems suspicious
[17:45:13] Adrian: tyler, can you explain what you were doing last night instead of celebrating so eagerly this morning
[17:45:18] Finley: adrian, you’ve pressed tyler and me relentlessly but still haven’t said what you were doing last night—care to explain
[17:45:30] Tyler: i was reviewing vote timestamps overnight to spot any patterns before speaking up
[17:45:31] Finley: adrian, why so keen to grill tyler instead of sharing your own night alibi
[17:45:34] Adrian: tyler, how do you respond to finley’s call to revisit kennedy’s dodged answers
[17:45:41] Finley: adrian, why haven’t you explained what you were doing last night
[17:45:44] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander.

The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew

[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney was voted out. Their role was mafia
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.

[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:59] Tyler: looks like we’ve flushed out all the mafia—nice work everyone
[17:43:07] Adrian: given that kennedy was the night kill, which of us seems the likeliest mafia now
[17:43:14] Finley: adrian’s eagerness to lead the charge without any new proof feels suspicious
[17:43:14] Tyler: looks like we’ve cleaned house—no mafia left
[17:43:24] Finley: tyler’s quick self-congratulations make me wonder if he’s deflecting
[17:43:28] Adrian: tyler, why so quick to celebrate after losing another bystander
[17:43:29] Tyler: adrian, what made you rule me out immediately and zero in on finley
[17:43:41] Finley: tyler’s confident “we’ve cleaned house” claim feels oddly convenient
[17:43:46] Adrian: tyler, what evidence backs up your claim that there’s no mafia left
[17:44:03] Finley: adrian, you dismissed tyler without a shred of evidence—what exactly convinced you
[17:44:07] Tyler: i see your point, but my votes were driven by behaviors, not convenience
[17:44:08] Adrian: tyler, why so confident we’re mafia-free when the killer is still among us
[17:44:31] Tyler: with sidney and kennedy exposed, there’s no mafia left among us
[17:44:39] Adrian: finley, what specific behavior made tyler’s quick celebration look like a deflection to you
[17:44:45] Tyler: adrian, what exactly about finley’s actions today makes her a bigger suspect than me
[17:44:50] Finley: tyler, your hasty celebration ignores your own silence on last night’s actions—what were you up to
[17:44:58] Adrian: finley, what exact behavior convinces you tyler isn’t the mafia
[17:45:03] Tyler: i was reviewing vote patterns overnight, not hiding anything—why does my silence worry you
[17:45:07] Finley: tyler, your eagerness to wrap this up without revisiting kennedy’s dodged answers seems suspicious
[17:45:13] Adrian: tyler, can you explain what you were doing last night instead of celebrating so eagerly this morning
[17:45:18] Finley: adrian, you’ve pressed tyler and me relentlessly but still haven’t said what you were doing last night—care to explain
[17:45:30] Tyler: i was reviewing vote timestamps overnight to spot any patterns before speaking up
[17:45:31] Finley: adrian, why so keen to grill tyler instead of sharing your own night alibi
[17:45:34] Adrian: tyler, how do you respond to finley’s call to revisit kennedy’s dodged answers
[17:45:41] Finley: adrian, why haven’t you explained what you were doing last night
[17:45:44] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider

[17:44:31] Tyler: with sidney and kennedy exposed, there’s no mafia left among us
[17:44:39] Adrian: finley, what specific behavior made tyler’s quick celebration look like a deflection to you
[17:44:45] Tyler: adrian, what exactly about finley’s actions today makes her a bigger suspect than me
[17:44:50] Finley: tyler, your hasty celebration ignores your own silence on last night’s actions—what were you up to
[17:44:58] Adrian: finley, what exact behavior convinces you tyler isn’t the mafia
[17:45:03] Tyler: i was reviewing vote patterns overnight, not hiding anything—why does my silence worry you
[17:45:07] Finley: tyler, your eagerness to wrap this up without revisiting kennedy’s dodged answers seems suspicious
[17:45:13] Adrian: tyler, can you explain what you were doing last night instead of celebrating so eagerly this morning
[17:45:18] Finley: adrian, you’ve pressed tyler and me relentlessly but still haven’t said what you were doing last night—care to explain
[17:45:30] Tyler: i was reviewing vote timestamps overnight to spot any patterns before speaking up
[17:45:31] Finley: adrian, why so keen to grill tyler instead of sharing your own night alibi
[17:45:34] Adrian: tyler, how do you respond to finley’s call to revisit kennedy’s dodged answers
[17:45:41] Finley: adrian, why haven’t you explained what you were doing last night
[17:45:44] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

## CONTENT: Your name is Adrian.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Finley 
 Tyler

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.

[17:38:07] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Drew

[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney was voted out. Their role was mafia
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.

[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:42:44] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:42:59] Tyler: looks like we’ve flushed out all the mafia—nice work everyone
[17:43:07] Adrian: given that kennedy was the night kill, which of us seems the likeliest mafia now
[17:43:14] Finley: adrian’s eagerness to lead the charge without any new proof feels suspicious
[17:43:14] Tyler: looks like we’ve cleaned house—no mafia left
[17:43:24] Finley: tyler’s quick self-congratulations make me wonder if he’s deflecting
[17:43:28] Adrian: tyler, why so quick to celebrate after losing another bystander
[17:43:29] Tyler: adrian, what made you rule me out immediately and zero in on finley
[17:43:41] Finley: tyler’s confident “we’ve cleaned house” claim feels oddly convenient
[17:43:46] Adrian: tyler, what evidence backs up your claim that there’s no mafia left
[17:44:03] Finley: adrian, you dismissed tyler without a shred of evidence—what exactly convinced you
[17:44:07] Tyler: i see your point, but my votes were driven by behaviors, not convenience
[17:44:08] Adrian: tyler, why so confident we’re mafia-free when the killer is still among us
