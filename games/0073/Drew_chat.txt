[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
