[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:38:35] Sidney: let’s eliminate drew tonight
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
