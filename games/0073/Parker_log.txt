## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].

[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd

[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night

[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Drew 
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Drew 
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Drew 
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Drew 
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker

[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].

[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated

The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.

[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him

[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said

[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night

[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen

[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Drew 
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Drew 
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander.

The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him

[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself

[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.
