[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:38:05] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[17:38:07] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Drew
[17:38:10] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[17:38:11] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Drew
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:42:12] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Sidney
[17:42:13] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[17:42:20] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sidney
[17:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[17:42:59] Tyler: looks like we’ve flushed out all the mafia—nice work everyone
[17:43:07] Adrian: given that kennedy was the night kill, which of us seems the likeliest mafia now
[17:43:14] Finley: adrian’s eagerness to lead the charge without any new proof feels suspicious
[17:43:14] Tyler: looks like we’ve cleaned house—no mafia left
[17:43:24] Finley: tyler’s quick self-congratulations make me wonder if he’s deflecting
[17:43:28] Adrian: tyler, why so quick to celebrate after losing another bystander
[17:43:29] Tyler: adrian, what made you rule me out immediately and zero in on finley
[17:43:41] Finley: tyler’s confident “we’ve cleaned house” claim feels oddly convenient
[17:43:46] Adrian: tyler, what evidence backs up your claim that there’s no mafia left
[17:44:03] Finley: adrian, you dismissed tyler without a shred of evidence—what exactly convinced you
[17:44:07] Tyler: i see your point, but my votes were driven by behaviors, not convenience
[17:44:08] Adrian: tyler, why so confident we’re mafia-free when the killer is still among us
[17:44:31] Tyler: with sidney and kennedy exposed, there’s no mafia left among us
[17:44:39] Adrian: finley, what specific behavior made tyler’s quick celebration look like a deflection to you
[17:44:45] Tyler: adrian, what exactly about finley’s actions today makes her a bigger suspect than me
[17:44:50] Finley: tyler, your hasty celebration ignores your own silence on last night’s actions—what were you up to
[17:44:58] Adrian: finley, what exact behavior convinces you tyler isn’t the mafia
[17:45:03] Tyler: i was reviewing vote patterns overnight, not hiding anything—why does my silence worry you
[17:45:07] Finley: tyler, your eagerness to wrap this up without revisiting kennedy’s dodged answers seems suspicious
[17:45:13] Adrian: tyler, can you explain what you were doing last night instead of celebrating so eagerly this morning
[17:45:18] Finley: adrian, you’ve pressed tyler and me relentlessly but still haven’t said what you were doing last night—care to explain
[17:45:30] Tyler: i was reviewing vote timestamps overnight to spot any patterns before speaking up
[17:45:31] Finley: adrian, why so keen to grill tyler instead of sharing your own night alibi
[17:45:34] Adrian: tyler, how do you respond to finley’s call to revisit kennedy’s dodged answers
[17:45:41] Finley: adrian, why haven’t you explained what you were doing last night
[17:45:44] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
