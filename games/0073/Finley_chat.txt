[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:38:31] Finley: locking in my vote on parker—let’s wrap this up
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:43:14] Finley: adrian’s eagerness to lead the charge without any new proof feels suspicious
[17:43:24] Finley: tyler’s quick self-congratulations make me wonder if he’s deflecting
[17:43:41] Finley: tyler’s confident “we’ve cleaned house” claim feels oddly convenient
[17:44:03] Finley: adrian, you dismissed tyler without a shred of evidence—what exactly convinced you
[17:44:50] Finley: tyler, your hasty celebration ignores your own silence on last night’s actions—what were you up to
[17:45:07] Finley: tyler, your eagerness to wrap this up without revisiting kennedy’s dodged answers seems suspicious
[17:45:18] Finley: adrian, you’ve pressed tyler and me relentlessly but still haven’t said what you were doing last night—care to explain
[17:45:31] Finley: adrian, why so keen to grill tyler instead of sharing your own night alibi
[17:45:41] Finley: adrian, why haven’t you explained what you were doing last night
