[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
