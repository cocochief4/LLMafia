## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Parker 
 Drew 
 Finley 
 Tyler 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:

In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share

[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now

Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself!

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].

[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander.

The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious

[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth

[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Parker 
 Drew 
 Finley 
 Tyler 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Parker 
 Drew

In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:

[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame

[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:

[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Parker 
 Drew 
 Finley 
 Tyler 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Parker 
 Drew 
 Finley 
 Tyler

<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof

[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far

[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far

[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd

[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler

[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt

[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient

[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself

[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported

[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Finley 
 Tyler

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>.

[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence

[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said

[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away

[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Finley 
 Tyler 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.

[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].

[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Finley 
 Tyler

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker

[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient

[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:38:05] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker

[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Parker (bystander)

[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew

[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take

[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Finley 
 Tyler

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>.

[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker

[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point

[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night

[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:

[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:38:05] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[17:38:07] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Drew

[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious

[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far

[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night

[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring

[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Finley 
 Tyler

You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>.

[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious

[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far

[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night

[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler

[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth

[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning

[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection

[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient

[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Finley

[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:

[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander

[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Finley 
 Tyler

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander

[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:

[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.

[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take

[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:

[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander

[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:

[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.

[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:

[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:

[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker

[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley 
 Tyler 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Finley 
 Tyler

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response.

[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker

[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why

[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself

[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:34:52].

[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:38:05] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker

[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander.

The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:34:52] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:34:58] Drew: hey everyone, ready to find the mafia among us
[17:34:59] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to kick things off—any early suspicions
[17:34:59] Finley: i wonder if anyone else noticed tyler being unusually quiet so far
[17:35:00] Sidney: hey everyone, who seems the most suspicious so far
[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:04] Drew: does anyone have any observations or suspicions before we vote
[17:35:07] Kennedy: i’m curious why parker’s so quiet—any thoughts
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:11] Sidney: tyler’s quietness is definitely suspicious—anyone else notice it
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:13] Finley: hey everyone, does parker's silence feel a bit suspicious
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:16] Drew: i didn't notice anything last night, but parker’s push for suspects stands out to me
[17:35:17] Kennedy: i’ve noticed tyler’s quiet—could that be a red flag
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:25] Finley: parker’s relentless questioning feels off—i’m voting parker
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:26] Kennedy: honestly, sidney’s rapid-fire questions and parker’s pushiness feel like deflection
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:32] Sidney: i think parker’s silence is more suspicious than tyler’s right now
[17:35:33] Finley: i’m curious why sidney keeps pushing to focus on tyler—what’s he hiding
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:35:46] Sidney: parker’s swift deflection is suspicious—why so eager to shift blame
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:49] Kennedy: before we vote parker, what exact evidence do we have against him
[17:35:50] Drew: i’m considering voting sidney for steering us back to tyler without any real proof
[17:35:55] Sidney: parker’s flip-flopping accusations seem oddly convenient
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:35:59] Kennedy: i agree—sidney, why hound tyler when parker’s deflections are just as glaring
[17:36:00] Drew: we don’t have concrete proof—just parker’s nonstop unfounded accusations and refusal to explain his reasoning
[17:36:01] Finley: i’m voting parker too—he’s all talk and no proof
[17:36:09] Kennedy: do we really have any concrete behaviors from parker to justify our vote
[17:36:10] Sidney: what about drew—he’s been oddly silent until now, maybe that’s our misdirection
[17:36:11] Drew: none of parker’s accusations hold up when asked for specifics—he’s our prime suspect
[17:36:13] Finley: i’m voting sidney—his redirections are too smooth
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:22] Drew: no concrete proof from parker—i'm voting him
[17:36:22] Sidney: parker’s early silence then sudden barrage of accusations screams a panic play
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:24] Finley: i haven’t heard a single concrete reason from parker—he’s got to go
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:34] Drew: i don’t see a single factual claim from parker—just empty deflections
[17:36:34] Kennedy: sidney, what proof do you have that drew is more suspicious than parker
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:40] Finley: sidney’s pivot to drew is just a last-minute misdirection—let’s lock in parker
[17:36:43] Kennedy: i’m voting parker—he still hasn’t provided any real evidence
[17:36:44] Sidney: i’m voting parker—his claims remain baseless and unsupported
[17:36:46] Drew: kennedy, which one are you voting for—parker or sidney
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:36:54] Sidney: parker’s refusal to back up his accusations makes him our obvious target
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:02] Finley: no more doubts—lynch parker now
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:08] Sidney: drew stayed silent until votes split, then jumped in to push parker, which feels orchestrated
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:19] Kennedy: locking in parker—he’s given us nothing concrete to reconsider
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
[17:37:27] Drew: i only jumped in to break the tie—sidney’s shifting blame feels like misdirection
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:37:31] Finley: parker’s defensiveness under pressure speaks volumes about his guilt
[17:37:34] Kennedy: if you haven’t locked in yet, vote parker so we can wrap this up
[17:37:36] Drew: i only broke the tie to move us forward, whereas parker still hasn’t offered any real substance
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:37:42] Kennedy: his evasive answers under pressure tell me all i need to know—parker is mafia
[17:37:46] Finley: sidney's nonstop deflections are looking a lot more suspicious than parker's empty accusations ever were
[17:37:51] Drew: his inability to back up his claims with any specific timing or examples really gave him away
[17:37:52] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:38:01] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[17:38:02] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:38:05] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker

[17:38:11] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Drew
[17:38:12] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[17:38:58] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:39:09] Finley: agreed—drew is the target tonight
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:20] Kennedy: i’m keeping an eye on sidney—his deflections lack any real evidence
[17:39:20] Finley: i’m curious why kennedy has been so quiet this morning—does anyone else find that odd
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:31] Sidney: locking in drew as our kill
[17:39:31] Kennedy: adrian’s silence now that we’ve lost two bystanders feels too convenient
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:36] Finley: sidney, what exact behaviors are you calling deflections
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:39:52] Sidney: sidney: given how quiet kennedy’s been until now, i’m starting to wonder what she’s hiding
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:39:55] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her silence this morning feels too convenient
[17:39:58] Kennedy: parker lobbed accusations with zero proof and drew jumped in at the perfect moment to seal the vote
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:13] Kennedy: i’m locking in my vote for kennedy—no explanation for her morning silence
[17:40:13] Sidney: kennedy’s sudden focus on deflections without any proof seems more suspicious than my questions
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:27] Finley: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—why dodge sidney’s point
[17:40:28] Kennedy: finley, you’ve called my silence too convenient—what actual mafia behavior have i displayed
[17:40:29] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy—her lack of engagement today is too suspicious
[17:40:49] Finley: kennedy, silence isn’t a defense—what are you hiding
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:40:50] Sidney: tyler, kennedy’s refusal to answer direct questions is telling—shall we lock her in
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:00] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t answered adrian’s question—what exactly are you hiding
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:07] Kennedy: finley and sidney, what specific mafia behavior have i shown beyond being quiet
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:17] Sidney: if kennedy’s silence isn’t proof enough, what is
[17:41:19] Finley: her long silence right after adrian asked for specifics showed she had nothing to say
[17:41:23] Kennedy: i was just thinking through the votes, not hiding anything—sidney, what’s your evidence against me
[17:41:32] Finley: kennedy, why the sudden radio silence whenever anyone presses you—own up or we vote you out
[17:41:33] Kennedy: besides my silence, what exact behavior have i displayed that makes you suspect me of being mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:41] Sidney: kennedy still hasn’t explained her night action, which feels like a tell
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:41:49] Kennedy: can we shift our focus to sidney’s shifting accusations instead of fixating on my quiet
[17:41:50] Finley: her refusal to answer direct questions speaks louder than any defense she could muster
[17:41:55] Sidney: kennedy, your silence about what you were doing last night speaks louder than words
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:41:58] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
