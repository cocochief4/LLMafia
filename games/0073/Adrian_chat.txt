[17:35:01] Adrian: i’d like to hear everyone’s thoughts—who seems most suspicious to you so far
[17:35:12] Adrian: fair point on tyler’s silence, but parker’s eagerness to question everyone else catches my eye
[17:35:26] Adrian: tyler’s silence is suspicious—tyler, any thoughts from last night
[17:35:37] Adrian: i’m with finley—parker’s non-stop accusations without evidence feel too suspicious
[17:35:48] Adrian: sidney, why focus on tyler instead of parker right now
[17:35:59] Adrian: our votes are split—let’s focus on parker to make a firm decision
[17:36:16] Adrian: can anyone point to a moment when parker offered actual evidence instead of baseless accusations
[17:36:29] Adrian: kennedy, who are you voting for—sidney or parker
[17:37:02] Adrian: without any real evidence, let’s lock in our vote on parker
[17:37:15] Adrian: locking in parker—he’s given zero proof
[17:37:31] Adrian: drew, you jumped in late—what tipped you off about parker
[17:39:25] Adrian: finley, you seemed very confident about lynching parker and drew—what concrete behaviors did you notice that convinced you of their guilt
[17:39:42] Adrian: sidney’s continued deflections without specifics seem off—anyone else catch that
[17:40:02] Adrian: sidney, which specific remark are you labelling as a smokescreen
[17:40:27] Adrian: finley, which pause from kennedy convinced you to vote her
[17:40:55] Adrian: tyler, which part of kennedy’s morning silence feels like a deflection
[17:41:16] Adrian: kennedy, what specific move did you make last night that proves you’re not mafia
[17:41:34] Adrian: sidney, you pushed hard for parker and drew—what makes you so sure about kennedy now
[17:41:49] Adrian: kennedy, instead of just defending yourself, can you point out someone you actually suspect and why
[17:43:07] Adrian: given that kennedy was the night kill, which of us seems the likeliest mafia now
[17:43:28] Adrian: tyler, why so quick to celebrate after losing another bystander
[17:43:46] Adrian: tyler, what evidence backs up your claim that there’s no mafia left
[17:44:08] Adrian: tyler, why so confident we’re mafia-free when the killer is still among us
[17:44:39] Adrian: finley, what specific behavior made tyler’s quick celebration look like a deflection to you
[17:44:58] Adrian: finley, what exact behavior convinces you tyler isn’t the mafia
[17:45:13] Adrian: tyler, can you explain what you were doing last night instead of celebrating so eagerly this morning
[17:45:34] Adrian: tyler, how do you respond to finley’s call to revisit kennedy’s dodged answers
