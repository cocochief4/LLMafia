[17:35:00] Parker: does anyone have initial suspects based on what we’ve seen so far
[17:35:10] Parker: i’m inclined to keep an eye on tyler since he hasn’t spoken up yet
[17:35:18] Parker: sorry, i was listening—does finley’s quick suspicion of tyler strike anyone else as odd
[17:35:27] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to steer us toward suspects feels like a distraction to me
[17:35:40] Parker: sidney’s nonstop questioning without any real evidence seems like a smokescreen
[17:35:57] Parker: he’s just throwing out names with no proof and dodging when we ask for details
[17:36:19] Parker: why are we rushing to lynch me with no concrete evidence
[17:36:33] Parker: sidney, you’ve only been redirecting suspicion without ever presenting any solid evidence yourself
[17:36:58] Parker: sidney, what exact behavior of drew’s made you so certain he’s the mafia
[17:37:11] Parker: voting on pure guesses with no proof is risky—can we pause and look for actual clues
[17:37:21] Parker: drew’s sudden push to lynch me looks far more orchestrated than anything i’ve said
