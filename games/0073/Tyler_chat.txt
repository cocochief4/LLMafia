[17:35:01] Tyler: does anyone have any observations from last night to share
[17:35:14] Tyler: sorry for the quiet—i'm thinking sidney’s quick questions are a bit suspicious
[17:35:24] Tyler: it feels fishy that parker’s so quick to accuse without offering any actual evidence
[17:35:35] Tyler: parker’s sudden deflection onto finley feels just as suspicious as the earlier rush on tyler
[17:35:43] Tyler: i’m voting sidney—his deflections seem too smooth
[17:36:23] Tyler: i’ll lock in my vote for parker unless someone can show real proof against him
[17:36:39] Tyler: sidney’s bouncing blame from tyler to drew to parker is too convenient
[17:36:50] Tyler: sidney, what concrete behaviors from drew make him more suspicious than parker
[17:37:04] Tyler: i’m sticking with parker—no one’s defended his empty accusations
[17:37:39] Tyler: drew’s sudden push to lynch parker without evidence feels even more orchestrated than parker’s accusations
[17:39:16] Tyler: we just lost two bystanders—let’s keep an eye on anyone deflecting when pressed for details
[17:39:36] Tyler: sidney’s quick shifts still feel off—anyone else noticing it
[17:39:54] Tyler: adrian, your fixation on finley feels like a diversion—what have you actually observed
[17:40:07] Tyler: agreed, kennedy’s silence now feels like a deflection—what’s your take
[17:40:49] Tyler: before we all lock in on kennedy, can someone point to more than her silence
[17:41:01] Tyler: finley, which of kennedy’s silent pauses convinced you she’s mafia
[17:41:12] Tyler: sidney, which direct question did kennedy refuse to answer this morning
[17:41:56] Tyler: adrian, which of kennedy’s votes today makes her look guilty
[17:42:59] Tyler: looks like we’ve flushed out all the mafia—nice work everyone
[17:43:14] Tyler: looks like we’ve cleaned house—no mafia left
[17:43:29] Tyler: adrian, what made you rule me out immediately and zero in on finley
[17:44:07] Tyler: i see your point, but my votes were driven by behaviors, not convenience
[17:44:31] Tyler: with sidney and kennedy exposed, there’s no mafia left among us
[17:44:45] Tyler: adrian, what exactly about finley’s actions today makes her a bigger suspect than me
[17:45:03] Tyler: i was reviewing vote patterns overnight, not hiding anything—why does my silence worry you
[17:45:30] Tyler: i was reviewing vote timestamps overnight to spot any patterns before speaking up
[17:46:40] Tyler: i’m voting adrian—still waiting on your night alibi
