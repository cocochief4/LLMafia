[21:16:33] Logan: anyone got any early gut feelings on who the mafia might be
[21:16:42] Logan: i saw alex join then leave the night chat super fast seemed odd
[21:16:52] Logan: ziggy’s eagerness to name suspects so quickly feels suspicious
[21:17:05] Logan: could someone else share a concrete reason to suspect me
[21:17:13] Logan: gray, why haven’t you commented on alex’s quick exit yet
[21:17:25] Logan: ziggy, can you explain why my eagerness is more suspicious than alex’s abrupt exit
