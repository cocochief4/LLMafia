[21:16:32] Gray: anyone noticed any odd behavior last night we can use to start suspecting someone
[21:16:39] Gray: hi everyone, who do you think is most suspicious
[21:16:47] Gray: logan’s eagerness to grab gut feelings feels a bit forced, i’m a bit suspicious of him
[21:17:11] Gray: alex’s sudden exit then silence feels fishy to me
[21:17:21] Gray: alex didn’t respond when i asked why they left the night chat, and that silence felt off
[21:17:55] Gray: voting alex—their unexplained night-chat exit is too suspicious
