[21:16:32] Gray: anyone noticed any odd behavior last night we can use to start suspecting someone
[21:16:33] Logan: anyone got any early gut feelings on who the mafia might be
[21:16:33] Ziggy: who do you two suspect so far
[21:16:39] Gray: hi everyone, who do you think is most suspicious
[21:16:42] Logan: i saw alex join then leave the night chat super fast seemed odd
[21:16:42] Ziggy: nothing jumped out last night but logans eagerness feels odd
[21:16:47] Gray: logan’s eagerness to grab gut feelings feels a bit forced, i’m a bit suspicious of him
[21:16:52] Logan: ziggy’s eagerness to name suspects so quickly feels suspicious
[21:16:55] Ziggy: funny how logan was the first to jump on alex’s exit, seems a bit convenient
[21:17:03] Ziggy: gray’s quietness feels just as suspicious as logan’s eagerness
[21:17:05] Logan: could someone else share a concrete reason to suspect me
[21:17:11] Gray: alex’s sudden exit then silence feels fishy to me
[21:17:13] Logan: gray, why haven’t you commented on alex’s quick exit yet
[21:17:21] Gray: alex didn’t respond when i asked why they left the night chat, and that silence felt off
[21:17:22] Ziggy: gray, care to explain why alex bailed so quickly last night
[21:17:25] Logan: ziggy, can you explain why my eagerness is more suspicious than alex’s abrupt exit
