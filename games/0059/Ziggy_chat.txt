[21:16:33] Ziggy: who do you two suspect so far
[21:16:42] Ziggy: nothing jumped out last night but logans eagerness feels odd
[21:16:55] Ziggy: funny how logan was the first to jump on alex’s exit, seems a bit convenient
[21:17:03] Ziggy: gray’s quietness feels just as suspicious as logan’s eagerness
[21:17:22] Ziggy: gray, care to explain why alex bailed so quickly last night
[21:17:58] Ziggy: i vote for logan
