[21:20:17] Ziggy: any gut feelings on who we should vote today
[21:20:22] Ziggy: logan’s been really quiet—i'm suspicious of him
[21:20:28] Ziggy: gray, you haven’t said much—who do you think looks shady
[21:20:44] Ziggy: it was your quick defense, logan, that caught my eye
[21:20:52] Ziggy: gray, why defend logan so adamantly when he's barely said anything
[21:20:57] Ziggy: gray, which seems stranger: logan’s quick defense or my eagerness to vote
[21:21:07] Ziggy: every time i pressed for details, logan dodged rather than answered—deflection like that is mafia behavior
[21:21:32] Ziggy: locking in my vote for logan—his deflections scream mafia
