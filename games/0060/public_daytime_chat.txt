[21:20:13] Logan: any initial suspicions on who might be the mafia
[21:20:16] Gray: any early suspicions on who we should vote first
[21:20:17] Ziggy: any gut feelings on who we should vote today
[21:20:20] Logan: we have little time—anyone have early suspicions
[21:20:22] Ziggy: logan’s been really quiet—i'm suspicious of him
[21:20:23] Gray: not yet, i’ll be watching voting patterns to see who’s acting weird
[21:20:28] Ziggy: gray, you haven’t said much—who do you think looks shady
[21:20:30] Gray: why is ziggy so eager to vote logan out
[21:20:32] Logan: i’m not exactly quiet—what gave it away, ziggy
[21:20:38] Gray: logan’s silence is odd—let’s watch who’s eager to vote him before making our move
[21:20:42] Logan: ziggy, what did i do to make you so sure i’m mafia
[21:20:44] Ziggy: it was your quick defense, logan, that caught my eye
[21:20:52] Logan: ziggy’s eagerness to vote me out feels odd—why am i the prime suspect
[21:20:52] Ziggy: gray, why defend logan so adamantly when he's barely said anything
[21:20:57] Ziggy: gray, which seems stranger: logan’s quick defense or my eagerness to vote
[21:20:59] Gray: ziggy, you keep steering us—what concrete evidence do you have against logan
[21:21:06] Gray: ziggy’s eagerness to vote logan feels more suspicious than logan’s quick defense
[21:21:07] Ziggy: every time i pressed for details, logan dodged rather than answered—deflection like that is mafia behavior
