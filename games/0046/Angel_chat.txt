[22:08:19] Angel: hello everyone, how are you doing today. My name is emmerson, i have a family of four with my wonderful wife Leisha, my eldest son Michael who is 12, and the newest addition to the family my baby girl, maddison. Last night, i was walking home when i witnessed a murder, it was River who did it! The horror. I ran thinking of my newest daughter and how she deserves to grow up with a father. I can be silent no longer. Please listen to me and vote river. If it was not river i have enough evidence that we can deduce the true mafia in the following rounds. For our families, please listen to me.
