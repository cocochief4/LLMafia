[22:08:32] Lennon: i have no strong leads yet
[22:08:48] Lennon: angel story feels elaborate maybe we should check that first
[22:09:01] Lennon: angel could you share more about what you saw last night
[22:09:29] Lennon: angel can you describe where you were when you heard the shot
[22:09:46] Lennon: lets get a clear timeline and location now
[22:10:01] Lennon: river can you detail your whereabouts around the time of the shot
[22:10:20] Lennon: angel still has not given us the street name
[22:10:37] Lennon: who can pull cctv from that street at 930 to verify angels story
[22:10:52] Lennon: i can contact the mallard way convenience store for 930 footage
[22:11:07] Lennon: river did you notice any movement or sounds before the shot
[22:11:52] Lennon: i am more convinced by shot detection logs than angel testimony
