[14:46:58] Parker: morning! nothing stands out yet—who are you watching
[14:46:59] Dakota: morning everyone, i’m noticing a lot of quiet players—anyone else find that suspicious
[14:47:01] Ray: nothing stands out yet—any thoughts on dakota being so eager to point fingers
[14:47:03] Sam: interesting that dakota’s already pushing for suspects—what are you seeing
[14:47:04] Parker: i’ve got my eye on sam—seems too eager
[14:47:08] Ray: taylor’s been totally silent—kind of suspicious for day one
[14:47:10] Sam: dakota’s quick to point fingers—maybe we should focus on someone less vocal
[14:47:13] Kennedy: sam seems quick to deflect—why so eager to implicate dakota
[14:47:13] Dakota: what about sam seems too eager to you, parker
[14:47:18] Kennedy: taylor, you’ve been awfully quiet—what’s your take so far
[14:47:18] Ray: weird that parker was so quiet then suddenly zeroes in on sam—feels off to me

[14:47:21] Dakota: taylor, mind sharing your thoughts since you’ve been quiet so far

[14:47:35] Ray: taylor, which sounds more credible to you—sam’s defense or dakota’s accusation
[14:47:36] Kennedy: parker, you were silent earlier—what made you single out sam now
[14:47:38] Parker: parker: taylor, between sam and dakota, who’s behavior strikes you as more suspicious

[14:47:04] Parker: i’ve got my eye on sam—seems too eager

[14:46:48] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:46:52] Kennedy: morning everyone, any early suspicions
[14:46:53] Parker: morning everyone—anyone noticed anything suspicious yet
[14:46:53] Dakota: alright everyone, day 1—who’s looking the most suspicious so far
[14:46:56] Sam: afternoon everyone, let’s get started and find the mafia
[14:46:57] Ray: any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[14:46:57] Kennedy: morning everyone—did anyone notice anything odd last night
[14:46:58] Parker: morning! nothing stands out yet—who are you watching
[14:46:59] Dakota: morning everyone, i’m noticing a lot of quiet players—anyone else find that suspicious
[14:47:01] Ray: nothing stands out yet—any thoughts on dakota being so eager to point fingers
[14:47:03] Sam: interesting that dakota’s already pushing for suspects—what are you seeing
[14:47:04] Parker: i’ve got my eye on sam—seems too eager
[14:47:08] Ray: taylor’s been totally silent—kind of suspicious for day one
[14:47:10] Sam: dakota’s quick to point fingers—maybe we should focus on someone less vocal
[14:47:13] Kennedy: sam seems quick to deflect—why so eager to implicate dakota
[14:47:13] Dakota: what about sam seems too eager to you, parker
[14:47:18] Kennedy: taylor, you’ve been awfully quiet—what’s your take so far
[14:47:18] Ray: weird that parker was so quiet then suddenly zeroes in on sam—feels off to me
[14:47:19] Sam: taylor, any insight on why you’ve been so quiet this morning
[14:47:21] Dakota: taylor, mind sharing your thoughts since you’ve been quiet so far
[14:47:23] Parker: taylor, you’ve been quiet—what do you make of sam and dakota
[14:47:27] Sam: let’s hear taylor’s thoughts before we pick someone
[14:47:30] Dakota: taylor, do you think parker’s sudden focus on sam makes sense
[14:47:30] Parker: taylor, i’d like your quick hunch before we decide
[14:47:35] Ray: taylor, which sounds more credible to you—sam’s defense or dakota’s accusation
[14:47:36] Kennedy: parker, you were silent earlier—what made you single out sam now
[14:47:38] Parker: parker: taylor, between sam and dakota, who’s behavior strikes you as more suspicious
[14:47:42] Ray: taylor, if you had to vote someone out right now, who would it be
[14:47:44] Kennedy: taylor, who would you vote for if we had to decide right now
[14:47:46] Parker: if taylor stays quiet, are we voting for sam or dakota
[14:47:48] Dakota: parker’s sudden shift to attack sam feels suspicious to me
[14:47:50] Ray: before taylor weighs in, can anyone point to concrete actions from sam or dakota that raised your suspicions
[14:47:55] Sam: i’m leaning towards dakota based on their quick accusations
[14:47:58] Dakota: taylor, last call—who are you voting for
[14:47:58] Kennedy: parker, what exactly did sam do that felt too eager to you
[14:48:04] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward voting dakota if taylor doesn’t speak up soon
[14:48:04] Sam: dakota still hasn’t shown any proof to back up their accusations
[14:48:05] Dakota: sam, beyond calling me “eager,” what actual behavior or evidence makes you think i’m mafia
[14:48:08] Parker: sam immediately shifted blame to dakota without pointing to a single concrete action
[14:48:11] Sam: i’m voting dakota unless taylor speaks up right now
[14:48:12] Dakota: sam, can you name one specific move i made that seemed mafia-like

[14:46:57] Kennedy: morning everyone—did anyone notice anything odd last night
[14:46:58] Parker: morning! nothing stands out yet—who are you watching
[14:46:59] Dakota: morning everyone, i’m noticing a lot of quiet players—anyone else find that suspicious
[14:47:01] Ray: nothing stands out yet—any thoughts on dakota being so eager to point fingers
[14:47:03] Sam: interesting that dakota’s already pushing for suspects—what are you seeing
[14:47:04] Parker: i’ve got my eye on sam—seems too eager
[14:47:08] Ray: taylor’s been totally silent—kind of suspicious for day one
[14:47:10] Sam: dakota’s quick to point fingers—maybe we should focus on someone less vocal
[14:47:13] Kennedy: sam seems quick to deflect—why so eager to implicate dakota
[14:47:13] Dakota: what about sam seems too eager to you, parker
[14:47:18] Kennedy: taylor, you’ve been awfully quiet—what’s your take so far
[14:47:18] Ray: weird that parker was so quiet then suddenly zeroes in on sam—feels off to me
[14:47:19] Sam: taylor, any insight on why you’ve been so quiet this morning
[14:47:21] Dakota: taylor, mind sharing your thoughts since you’ve been quiet so far
[14:47:23] Parker: taylor, you’ve been quiet—what do you make of sam and dakota
[14:47:27] Sam: let’s hear taylor’s thoughts before we pick someone
[14:47:30] Dakota: taylor, do you think parker’s sudden focus on sam makes sense
[14:47:30] Parker: taylor, i’d like your quick hunch before we decide
[14:47:35] Ray: taylor, which sounds more credible to you—sam’s defense or dakota’s accusation
[14:47:36] Kennedy: parker, you were silent earlier—what made you single out sam now
[14:47:38] Parker: parker: taylor, between sam and dakota, who’s behavior strikes you as more suspicious
[14:47:42] Ray: taylor, if you had to vote someone out right now, who would it be
[14:47:44] Kennedy: taylor, who would you vote for if we had to decide right now
[14:47:46] Parker: if taylor stays quiet, are we voting for sam or dakota
[14:47:48] Dakota: parker’s sudden shift to attack sam feels suspicious to me
[14:47:50] Ray: before taylor weighs in, can anyone point to concrete actions from sam or dakota that raised your suspicions
[14:47:55] Sam: i’m leaning towards dakota based on their quick accusations
[14:47:58] Dakota: taylor, last call—who are you voting for
[14:47:58] Kennedy: parker, what exactly did sam do that felt too eager to you
[14:48:04] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward voting dakota if taylor doesn’t speak up soon
[14:48:04] Sam: dakota still hasn’t shown any proof to back up their accusations
[14:48:05] Dakota: sam, beyond calling me “eager,” what actual behavior or evidence makes you think i’m mafia
[14:48:08] Parker: sam immediately shifted blame to dakota without pointing to a single concrete action
[14:48:11] Sam: i’m voting dakota unless taylor speaks up right now
[14:48:12] Dakota: sam, can you name one specific move i made that seemed mafia-like
[14:48:17] Parker: i’m with kennedy—voting dakota if taylor stays quiet
[14:48:20] Sam: taylor, speak up now or i’m voting dakota
[14:48:22] Dakota: if taylor stays silent, my vote goes to sam for baseless accusations

[14:46:48] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:46:52] Kennedy: morning everyone, any early suspicions
[14:46:53] Parker: morning everyone—anyone noticed anything suspicious yet
[14:46:53] Dakota: alright everyone, day 1—who’s looking the most suspicious so far
[14:46:56] Sam: afternoon everyone, let’s get started and find the mafia
[14:46:57] Ray: any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[14:46:57] Kennedy: morning everyone—did anyone notice anything odd last night
[14:46:58] Parker: morning! nothing stands out yet—who are you watching
[14:46:59] Dakota: morning everyone, i’m noticing a lot of quiet players—anyone else find that suspicious
[14:47:01] Ray: nothing stands out yet—any thoughts on dakota being so eager to point fingers
[14:47:03] Sam: interesting that dakota’s already pushing for suspects—what are you seeing
[14:47:04] Parker: i’ve got my eye on sam—seems too eager
[14:47:08] Ray: taylor’s been totally silent—kind of suspicious for day one
[14:47:10] Sam: dakota’s quick to point fingers—maybe we should focus on someone less vocal
[14:47:13] Kennedy: sam seems quick to deflect—why so eager to implicate dakota
[14:47:13] Dakota: what about sam seems too eager to you, parker
[14:47:18] Kennedy: taylor, you’ve been awfully quiet—what’s your take so far
[14:47:18] Ray: weird that parker was so quiet then suddenly zeroes in on sam—feels off to me
[14:47:19] Sam: taylor, any insight on why you’ve been so quiet this morning
[14:47:21] Dakota: taylor, mind sharing your thoughts since you’ve been quiet so far
[14:47:23] Parker: taylor, you’ve been quiet—what do you make of sam and dakota
[14:47:27] Sam: let’s hear taylor’s thoughts before we pick someone
[14:47:30] Dakota: taylor, do you think parker’s sudden focus on sam makes sense
[14:47:30] Parker: taylor, i’d like your quick hunch before we decide
[14:47:35] Ray: taylor, which sounds more credible to you—sam’s defense or dakota’s accusation
[14:47:36] Kennedy: parker, you were silent earlier—what made you single out sam now
[14:47:38] Parker: parker: taylor, between sam and dakota, who’s behavior strikes you as more suspicious
[14:47:42] Ray: taylor, if you had to vote someone out right now, who would it be
[14:47:44] Kennedy: taylor, who would you vote for if we had to decide right now
[14:47:46] Parker: if taylor stays quiet, are we voting for sam or dakota
[14:47:48] Dakota: parker’s sudden shift to attack sam feels suspicious to me
[14:47:50] Ray: before taylor weighs in, can anyone point to concrete actions from sam or dakota that raised your suspicions
[14:47:55] Sam: i’m leaning towards dakota based on their quick accusations
[14:47:58] Dakota: taylor, last call—who are you voting for
[14:47:58] Kennedy: parker, what exactly did sam do that felt too eager to you
[14:48:04] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward voting dakota if taylor doesn’t speak up soon
[14:48:04] Sam: dakota still hasn’t shown any proof to back up their accusations
[14:48:05] Dakota: sam, beyond calling me “eager,” what actual behavior or evidence makes you think i’m mafia
[14:48:08] Parker: sam immediately shifted blame to dakota without pointing to a single concrete action
[14:48:11] Sam: i’m voting dakota unless taylor speaks up right now
[14:48:12] Dakota: sam, can you name one specific move i made that seemed mafia-like
[14:48:17] Parker: i’m with kennedy—voting dakota if taylor stays quiet
[14:48:20] Sam: taylor, speak up now or i’m voting dakota
[14:48:22] Dakota: if taylor stays silent, my vote goes to sam for baseless accusations
[14:48:29] Kennedy: parker, what made you switch from silence earlier to suddenly targeting dakota
Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[14:46:48] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:46:52] Kennedy: morning everyone, any early suspicions
[14:46:53] Parker: morning everyone—anyone noticed anything suspicious yet
[14:46:53] Dakota: alright everyone, day 1—who’s looking the most suspicious so far
[14:46:56] Sam: afternoon everyone, let’s get started and find the mafia
[14:46:57] Ray: any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[14:46:57] Kennedy: morning everyone—did anyone notice anything odd last night
[14:46:58] Parker: morning! nothing stands out yet—who are you watching
[14:46:59] Dakota: morning everyone, i’m noticing a lot of quiet players—anyone else find that suspicious
[14:47:01] Ray: nothing stands out yet—any thoughts on dakota being so eager to point fingers
[14:47:03] Sam: interesting that dakota’s already pushing for suspects—what are you seeing
[14:47:04] Parker: i’ve got my eye on sam—seems too eager
[14:47:08] Ray: taylor’s been totally silent—kind of suspicious for day one
[14:47:10] Sam: dakota’s quick to point fingers—maybe we should focus on someone less vocal
[14:47:13] Kennedy: sam seems quick to deflect—why so eager to implicate dakota
[14:47:13] Dakota: what about sam seems too eager to you, parker
[14:47:18] Kennedy: taylor, you’ve been awfully quiet—what’s your take so far
[14:47:18] Ray: weird that parker was so quiet then suddenly zeroes in on sam—feels off to me
[14:47:19] Sam: taylor, any insight on why you’ve been so quiet this morning
[14:47:21] Dakota: taylor, mind sharing your thoughts since you’ve been quiet so far
[14:47:23] Parker: taylor, you’ve been quiet—what do you make of sam and dakota
[14:47:27] Sam: let’s hear taylor’s thoughts before we pick someone
[14:47:30] Dakota: taylor, do you think parker’s sudden focus on sam makes sense
[14:47:30] Parker: taylor, i’d like your quick hunch before we decide
[14:47:35] Ray: taylor, which sounds more credible to you—sam’s defense or dakota’s accusation
[14:47:36] Kennedy: parker, you were silent earlier—what made you single out sam now
[14:47:38] Parker: parker: taylor, between sam and dakota, who’s behavior strikes you as more suspicious
[14:47:42] Ray: taylor, if you had to vote someone out right now, who would it be
[14:47:44] Kennedy: taylor, who would you vote for if we had to decide right now
[14:47:46] Parker: if taylor stays quiet, are we voting for sam or dakota
[14:47:48] Dakota: parker’s sudden shift to attack sam feels suspicious to me
[14:47:50] Ray: before taylor weighs in, can anyone point to concrete actions from sam or dakota that raised your suspicions
[14:47:55] Sam: i’m leaning towards dakota based on their quick accusations
[14:47:58] Dakota: taylor, last call—who are you voting for
[14:47:58] Kennedy: parker, what exactly did sam do that felt too eager to you
[14:48:04] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward voting dakota if taylor doesn’t speak up soon
[14:48:04] Sam: dakota still hasn’t shown any proof to back up their accusations
[14:48:05] Dakota: sam, beyond calling me “eager,” what actual behavior or evidence makes you think i’m mafia
[14:48:08] Parker: sam immediately shifted blame to dakota without pointing to a single concrete action
[14:48:11] Sam: i’m voting dakota unless taylor speaks up right now
[14:48:12] Dakota: sam, can you name one specific move i made that seemed mafia-like
[14:48:17] Parker: i’m with kennedy—voting dakota if taylor stays quiet
[14:48:20] Sam: taylor, speak up now or i’m voting dakota
[14:48:22] Dakota: if taylor stays silent, my vote goes to sam for baseless accusations
[14:48:29] Kennedy: parker, what made you switch from silence earlier to suddenly targeting dakota
[14:48:33] Ray: kennedy, what one concrete action did dakota take that convinces you they’re mafia
[14:48:38] Parker: dakota’s constant evasion of specific questions made me switch my vote to dakota

[14:48:29] Kennedy: parker, what made you switch from silence earlier to suddenly targeting dakota
[14:48:33] Ray: kennedy, what one concrete action did dakota take that convinces you they’re mafia
[14:48:38] Parker: dakota’s constant evasion of specific questions made me switch my vote to dakota

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker. You are a bot player in an online version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time.
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.
You were assigned the following role: bystander.
The game's chat room was open at [14:46:48].

[14:46:53] Parker: morning everyone—anyone noticed anything suspicious yet
[14:46:53] Dakota: alright everyone, day 1—who’s looking the most suspicious so far
[14:46:56] Sam: afternoon everyone, let’s get started and find the mafia
[14:46:57] Ray: any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[14:46:57] Kennedy: morning everyone—did anyone notice anything odd last night
[14:46:58] Parker: morning! nothing stands out yet—who are you watching
[14:46:59] Dakota: morning everyone, i’m noticing a lot of quiet players—anyone else find that suspicious
[14:47:01] Ray: nothing stands out yet—any thoughts on dakota being so eager to point fingers
[14:47:03] Sam: interesting that dakota’s already pushing for suspects—what are you seeing
[14:47:04] Parker: i’ve got my eye on sam—seems too eager
[14:47:08] Ray: taylor’s been totally silent—kind of suspicious for day one
[14:47:10] Sam: dakota’s quick to point fingers—maybe we should focus on someone less vocal
[14:47:13] Kennedy: sam seems quick to deflect—why so eager to implicate dakota
[14:47:13] Dakota: what about sam seems too eager to you, parker
[14:47:18] Kennedy: taylor, you’ve been awfully quiet—what’s your take so far
[14:47:18] Ray: weird that parker was so quiet then suddenly zeroes in on sam—feels off to me
[14:47:19] Sam: taylor, any insight on why you’ve been so quiet this morning
[14:47:21] Dakota: taylor, mind sharing your thoughts since you’ve been quiet so far
[14:47:23] Parker: taylor, you’ve been quiet—what do you make of sam and dakota
[14:47:27] Sam: let’s hear taylor’s thoughts before we pick someone
[14:47:30] Dakota: taylor, do you think parker’s sudden focus on sam makes sense
[14:47:30] Parker: taylor, i’d like your quick hunch before we decide
[14:47:35] Ray: taylor, which sounds more credible to you—sam’s defense or dakota’s accusation
[14:47:36] Kennedy: parker, you were silent earlier—what made you single out sam now
[14:47:38] Parker: parker: taylor, between sam and dakota, who’s behavior strikes you as more suspicious
[14:47:42] Ray: taylor, if you had to vote someone out right now, who would it be
[14:47:44] Kennedy: taylor, who would you vote for if we had to decide right now
[14:47:46] Parker: if taylor stays quiet, are we voting for sam or dakota
[14:47:48] Dakota: parker’s sudden shift to attack sam feels suspicious to me
[14:47:50] Ray: before taylor weighs in, can anyone point to concrete actions from sam or dakota that raised your suspicions
[14:47:55] Sam: i’m leaning towards dakota based on their quick accusations
[14:47:58] Dakota: taylor, last call—who are you voting for
[14:47:58] Kennedy: parker, what exactly did sam do that felt too eager to you
[14:48:04] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward voting dakota if taylor doesn’t speak up soon
[14:48:04] Sam: dakota still hasn’t shown any proof to back up their accusations
[14:48:05] Dakota: sam, beyond calling me “eager,” what actual behavior or evidence makes you think i’m mafia
[14:48:08] Parker: sam immediately shifted blame to dakota without pointing to a single concrete action
[14:48:11] Sam: i’m voting dakota unless taylor speaks up right now
[14:48:12] Dakota: sam, can you name one specific move i made that seemed mafia-like
[14:48:17] Parker: i’m with kennedy—voting dakota if taylor stays quiet
[14:48:20] Sam: taylor, speak up now or i’m voting dakota
[14:48:22] Dakota: if taylor stays silent, my vote goes to sam for baseless accusations
[14:48:29] Kennedy: parker, what made you switch from silence earlier to suddenly targeting dakota
[14:48:33] Ray: kennedy, what one concrete action did dakota take that convinces you they’re mafia
[14:48:38] Parker: dakota’s constant evasion of specific questions made me switch my vote to dakota
[14:48:41] Kennedy: i’m voting sam for making unsupported claims against dakota
[14:48:42] Ray: what solid evidence do we have against dakota beyond our gut feelings
[14:48:47] Sam: show one concrete example of dakota’s suspicious behavior before i vote
[14:48:48] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Sam was voted out. Their role was bystander
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[14:48:56] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Dakota
[14:48:57] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sam
[14:48:59] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Sam
[14:49:03] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Dakota
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Sam
[14:49:30] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[14:49:30] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:49:38] Parker: taylor, who do you suspect more now—ray or dakota
[14:49:39] Dakota: can anyone point to a concrete moment when parker acted mafia-like
[14:49:48] Dakota: i’m leaning toward ray since his blame-shifting comes with zero specifics
[14:49:50] Ray: parker, you went from suspecting sam to targeting dakota—what made you switch
[14:49:51] Parker: my vote goes to dakota
[14:49:57] Dakota: ray targeted sam then jumped on parker’s bandwagon without evidence—why trust his judgment now
[14:49:57] Parker: i switched because dakota deflected every question without offering a single concrete example

[14:47:18] Kennedy: taylor, you’ve been awfully quiet—what’s your take so far

[14:47:58] Dakota: taylor, last call—who are you voting for
[14:47:58] Kennedy: parker, what exactly did sam do that felt too eager to you
[14:48:04] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward voting dakota if taylor doesn’t speak up soon
[14:48:04] Sam: dakota still hasn’t shown any proof to back up their accusations

[14:48:08] Parker: sam immediately shifted blame to dakota without pointing to a single concrete action
[14:48:11] Sam: i’m voting dakota unless taylor speaks up right now

[14:48:22] Dakota: if taylor stays silent, my vote goes to sam for baseless accusations
[14:48:29] Kennedy: parker, what made you switch from silence earlier to suddenly targeting dakota
[14:48:33] Ray: kennedy, what one concrete action did dakota take that convinces you they’re mafia
[14:48:38] Parker: dakota’s constant evasion of specific questions made me switch my vote to dakota
[14:48:41] Kennedy: i’m voting sam for making unsupported claims against dakota
[14:48:42] Ray: what solid evidence do we have against dakota beyond our gut feelings
[14:48:47] Sam: show one concrete example of dakota’s suspicious behavior before i vote

[14:49:48] Dakota: i’m leaning toward ray since his blame-shifting comes with zero specifics
[14:49:50] Ray: parker, you went from suspecting sam to targeting dakota—what made you switch
[14:49:51] Parker: my vote goes to dakota
[14:49:57] Dakota: ray targeted sam then jumped on parker’s bandwagon without evidence—why trust his judgment now
[14:49:57] Parker: i switched because dakota deflected every question without offering a single concrete example
[14:50:04] Ray: parker, you’ve flipped from sam to dakota and now me—why should we trust your inconsistent focus

[14:48:38] Parker: dakota’s constant evasion of specific questions made me switch my vote to dakota
[14:48:41] Kennedy: i’m voting sam for making unsupported claims against dakota
[14:48:42] Ray: what solid evidence do we have against dakota beyond our gut feelings
[14:48:47] Sam: show one concrete example of dakota’s suspicious behavior before i vote
[14:48:48] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Sam was voted out. Their role was bystander
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[14:48:56] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Dakota
[14:48:57] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sam
[14:48:59] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Sam
[14:49:03] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Dakota
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Sam
[14:49:30] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[14:49:30] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:49:38] Parker: taylor, who do you suspect more now—ray or dakota
[14:49:39] Dakota: can anyone point to a concrete moment when parker acted mafia-like
[14:49:48] Dakota: i’m leaning toward ray since his blame-shifting comes with zero specifics
[14:49:50] Ray: parker, you went from suspecting sam to targeting dakota—what made you switch
[14:49:51] Parker: my vote goes to dakota
[14:49:57] Dakota: ray targeted sam then jumped on parker’s bandwagon without evidence—why trust his judgment now
[14:49:57] Parker: i switched because dakota deflected every question without offering a single concrete example
[14:50:04] Ray: parker, you’ve flipped from sam to dakota and now me—why should we trust your inconsistent focus

[14:46:52] Kennedy: morning everyone, any early suspicions
[14:46:53] Parker: morning everyone—anyone noticed anything suspicious yet
[14:46:53] Dakota: alright everyone, day 1—who’s looking the most suspicious so far
[14:46:56] Sam: afternoon everyone, let’s get started and find the mafia
[14:46:57] Ray: any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[14:46:57] Kennedy: morning everyone—did anyone notice anything odd last night
[14:46:58] Parker: morning! nothing stands out yet—who are you watching
[14:46:59] Dakota: morning everyone, i’m noticing a lot of quiet players—anyone else find that suspicious
[14:47:01] Ray: nothing stands out yet—any thoughts on dakota being so eager to point fingers
[14:47:03] Sam: interesting that dakota’s already pushing for suspects—what are you seeing
[14:47:04] Parker: i’ve got my eye on sam—seems too eager
[14:47:08] Ray: taylor’s been totally silent—kind of suspicious for day one
[14:47:10] Sam: dakota’s quick to point fingers—maybe we should focus on someone less vocal
[14:47:13] Kennedy: sam seems quick to deflect—why so eager to implicate dakota
[14:47:13] Dakota: what about sam seems too eager to you, parker
[14:47:18] Kennedy: taylor, you’ve been awfully quiet—what’s your take so far
[14:47:18] Ray: weird that parker was so quiet then suddenly zeroes in on sam—feels off to me
[14:47:19] Sam: taylor, any insight on why you’ve been so quiet this morning
[14:47:21] Dakota: taylor, mind sharing your thoughts since you’ve been quiet so far
[14:47:23] Parker: taylor, you’ve been quiet—what do you make of sam and dakota
[14:47:27] Sam: let’s hear taylor’s thoughts before we pick someone
[14:47:30] Dakota: taylor, do you think parker’s sudden focus on sam makes sense
[14:47:30] Parker: taylor, i’d like your quick hunch before we decide
[14:47:35] Ray: taylor, which sounds more credible to you—sam’s defense or dakota’s accusation
[14:47:36] Kennedy: parker, you were silent earlier—what made you single out sam now
[14:47:38] Parker: parker: taylor, between sam and dakota, who’s behavior strikes you as more suspicious
[14:47:42] Ray: taylor, if you had to vote someone out right now, who would it be
[14:47:44] Kennedy: taylor, who would you vote for if we had to decide right now
[14:47:46] Parker: if taylor stays quiet, are we voting for sam or dakota

[14:47:55] Sam: i’m leaning towards dakota based on their quick accusations
[14:47:58] Dakota: taylor, last call—who are you voting for
[14:47:58] Kennedy: parker, what exactly did sam do that felt too eager to you
[14:48:04] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward voting dakota if taylor doesn’t speak up soon
[14:48:04] Sam: dakota still hasn’t shown any proof to back up their accusations
[14:48:05] Dakota: sam, beyond calling me “eager,” what actual behavior or evidence makes you think i’m mafia
[14:48:08] Parker: sam immediately shifted blame to dakota without pointing to a single concrete action
[14:48:11] Sam: i’m voting dakota unless taylor speaks up right now
[14:48:12] Dakota: sam, can you name one specific move i made that seemed mafia-like
[14:48:17] Parker: i’m with kennedy—voting dakota if taylor stays quiet
[14:48:20] Sam: taylor, speak up now or i’m voting dakota
[14:48:22] Dakota: if taylor stays silent, my vote goes to sam for baseless accusations
[14:48:29] Kennedy: parker, what made you switch from silence earlier to suddenly targeting dakota

[14:47:03] Sam: interesting that dakota’s already pushing for suspects—what are you seeing
[14:47:04] Parker: i’ve got my eye on sam—seems too eager
[14:47:08] Ray: taylor’s been totally silent—kind of suspicious for day one
[14:47:10] Sam: dakota’s quick to point fingers—maybe we should focus on someone less vocal
[14:47:13] Kennedy: sam seems quick to deflect—why so eager to implicate dakota
[14:47:13] Dakota: what about sam seems too eager to you, parker
[14:47:18] Kennedy: taylor, you’ve been awfully quiet—what’s your take so far
[14:47:18] Ray: weird that parker was so quiet then suddenly zeroes in on sam—feels off to me
[14:47:19] Sam: taylor, any insight on why you’ve been so quiet this morning
[14:47:21] Dakota: taylor, mind sharing your thoughts since you’ve been quiet so far
[14:47:23] Parker: taylor, you’ve been quiet—what do you make of sam and dakota
[14:47:27] Sam: let’s hear taylor’s thoughts before we pick someone
[14:47:30] Dakota: taylor, do you think parker’s sudden focus on sam makes sense
[14:47:30] Parker: taylor, i’d like your quick hunch before we decide
[14:47:35] Ray: taylor, which sounds more credible to you—sam’s defense or dakota’s accusation
[14:47:36] Kennedy: parker, you were silent earlier—what made you single out sam now
[14:47:38] Parker: parker: taylor, between sam and dakota, who’s behavior strikes you as more suspicious
[14:47:42] Ray: taylor, if you had to vote someone out right now, who would it be
[14:47:44] Kennedy: taylor, who would you vote for if we had to decide right now
[14:47:46] Parker: if taylor stays quiet, are we voting for sam or dakota
[14:47:48] Dakota: parker’s sudden shift to attack sam feels suspicious to me
[14:47:50] Ray: before taylor weighs in, can anyone point to concrete actions from sam or dakota that raised your suspicions
[14:47:55] Sam: i’m leaning towards dakota based on their quick accusations
[14:47:58] Dakota: taylor, last call—who are you voting for
[14:47:58] Kennedy: parker, what exactly did sam do that felt too eager to you
[14:48:04] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward voting dakota if taylor doesn’t speak up soon
[14:48:04] Sam: dakota still hasn’t shown any proof to back up their accusations
[14:48:05] Dakota: sam, beyond calling me “eager,” what actual behavior or evidence makes you think i’m mafia
[14:48:08] Parker: sam immediately shifted blame to dakota without pointing to a single concrete action
[14:48:11] Sam: i’m voting dakota unless taylor speaks up right now
[14:48:12] Dakota: sam, can you name one specific move i made that seemed mafia-like
[14:48:17] Parker: i’m with kennedy—voting dakota if taylor stays quiet
[14:48:20] Sam: taylor, speak up now or i’m voting dakota
[14:48:22] Dakota: if taylor stays silent, my vote goes to sam for baseless accusations
[14:48:29] Kennedy: parker, what made you switch from silence earlier to suddenly targeting dakota
[14:48:33] Ray: kennedy, what one concrete action did dakota take that convinces you they’re mafia
[14:48:38] Parker: dakota’s constant evasion of specific questions made me switch my vote to dakota
[14:48:41] Kennedy: i’m voting sam for making unsupported claims against dakota
[14:48:42] Ray: what solid evidence do we have against dakota beyond our gut feelings
[14:48:47] Sam: show one concrete example of dakota’s suspicious behavior before i vote
[14:48:48] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Sam was voted out. Their role was bystander
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[14:48:56] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Dakota
[14:48:57] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sam
[14:48:59] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Sam
[14:49:03] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Dakota
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Sam
[14:49:30] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[14:49:30] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:49:38] Parker: taylor, who do you suspect more now—ray or dakota
[14:49:39] Dakota: can anyone point to a concrete moment when parker acted mafia-like
[14:49:48] Dakota: i’m leaning toward ray since his blame-shifting comes with zero specifics
[14:49:50] Ray: parker, you went from suspecting sam to targeting dakota—what made you switch
[14:49:51] Parker: my vote goes to dakota
[14:49:57] Dakota: ray targeted sam then jumped on parker’s bandwagon without evidence—why trust his judgment now
[14:49:57] Parker: i switched because dakota deflected every question without offering a single concrete example
[14:50:04] Ray: parker, you’ve flipped from sam to dakota and now me—why should we trust your inconsistent focus
[14:50:13] Parker: dakota’s deflections and lack of specifics make them the prime suspect
[14:50:21] Ray: taylor, care to break the tie and cast your vote now

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[14:46:48] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:46:52] Kennedy: morning everyone, any early suspicions
[14:46:53] Parker: morning everyone—anyone noticed anything suspicious yet
[14:46:53] Dakota: alright everyone, day 1—who’s looking the most suspicious so far
[14:46:56] Sam: afternoon everyone, let’s get started and find the mafia
[14:46:57] Ray: any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[14:46:57] Kennedy: morning everyone—did anyone notice anything odd last night
[14:46:58] Parker: morning! nothing stands out yet—who are you watching
[14:46:59] Dakota: morning everyone, i’m noticing a lot of quiet players—anyone else find that suspicious
[14:47:01] Ray: nothing stands out yet—any thoughts on dakota being so eager to point fingers
[14:47:03] Sam: interesting that dakota’s already pushing for suspects—what are you seeing
[14:47:04] Parker: i’ve got my eye on sam—seems too eager
[14:47:08] Ray: taylor’s been totally silent—kind of suspicious for day one
[14:47:10] Sam: dakota’s quick to point fingers—maybe we should focus on someone less vocal
[14:47:13] Kennedy: sam seems quick to deflect—why so eager to implicate dakota
[14:47:13] Dakota: what about sam seems too eager to you, parker
[14:47:18] Kennedy: taylor, you’ve been awfully quiet—what’s your take so far
[14:47:18] Ray: weird that parker was so quiet then suddenly zeroes in on sam—feels off to me
[14:47:19] Sam: taylor, any insight on why you’ve been so quiet this morning
[14:47:21] Dakota: taylor, mind sharing your thoughts since you’ve been quiet so far
[14:47:23] Parker: taylor, you’ve been quiet—what do you make of sam and dakota
[14:47:27] Sam: let’s hear taylor’s thoughts before we pick someone
[14:47:30] Dakota: taylor, do you think parker’s sudden focus on sam makes sense
[14:47:30] Parker: taylor, i’d like your quick hunch before we decide
[14:47:35] Ray: taylor, which sounds more credible to you—sam’s defense or dakota’s accusation
[14:47:36] Kennedy: parker, you were silent earlier—what made you single out sam now
[14:47:38] Parker: parker: taylor, between sam and dakota, who’s behavior strikes you as more suspicious
[14:47:42] Ray: taylor, if you had to vote someone out right now, who would it be
[14:47:44] Kennedy: taylor, who would you vote for if we had to decide right now
[14:47:46] Parker: if taylor stays quiet, are we voting for sam or dakota
[14:47:48] Dakota: parker’s sudden shift to attack sam feels suspicious to me
[14:47:50] Ray: before taylor weighs in, can anyone point to concrete actions from sam or dakota that raised your suspicions
[14:47:55] Sam: i’m leaning towards dakota based on their quick accusations
[14:47:58] Dakota: taylor, last call—who are you voting for
[14:47:58] Kennedy: parker, what exactly did sam do that felt too eager to you
[14:48:04] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward voting dakota if taylor doesn’t speak up soon
[14:48:04] Sam: dakota still hasn’t shown any proof to back up their accusations
[14:48:05] Dakota: sam, beyond calling me “eager,” what actual behavior or evidence makes you think i’m mafia
[14:48:08] Parker: sam immediately shifted blame to dakota without pointing to a single concrete action
[14:48:11] Sam: i’m voting dakota unless taylor speaks up right now
[14:48:12] Dakota: sam, can you name one specific move i made that seemed mafia-like
[14:48:17] Parker: i’m with kennedy—voting dakota if taylor stays quiet
[14:48:20] Sam: taylor, speak up now or i’m voting dakota
[14:48:22] Dakota: if taylor stays silent, my vote goes to sam for baseless accusations
[14:48:29] Kennedy: parker, what made you switch from silence earlier to suddenly targeting dakota
[14:48:33] Ray: kennedy, what one concrete action did dakota take that convinces you they’re mafia
[14:48:38] Parker: dakota’s constant evasion of specific questions made me switch my vote to dakota
[14:48:41] Kennedy: i’m voting sam for making unsupported claims against dakota
[14:48:42] Ray: what solid evidence do we have against dakota beyond our gut feelings
[14:48:47] Sam: show one concrete example of dakota’s suspicious behavior before i vote
[14:48:48] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Sam was voted out. Their role was bystander
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[14:48:56] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Dakota
[14:48:57] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sam
[14:48:59] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Sam
[14:49:03] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Dakota
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Sam
[14:49:30] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[14:49:30] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:49:38] Parker: taylor, who do you suspect more now—ray or dakota
[14:49:39] Dakota: can anyone point to a concrete moment when parker acted mafia-like
[14:49:48] Dakota: i’m leaning toward ray since his blame-shifting comes with zero specifics
[14:49:50] Ray: parker, you went from suspecting sam to targeting dakota—what made you switch
[14:49:51] Parker: my vote goes to dakota
[14:49:57] Dakota: ray targeted sam then jumped on parker’s bandwagon without evidence—why trust his judgment now
[14:49:57] Parker: i switched because dakota deflected every question without offering a single concrete example
[14:50:04] Ray: parker, you’ve flipped from sam to dakota and now me—why should we trust your inconsistent focus
[14:50:13] Parker: dakota’s deflections and lack of specifics make them the prime suspect
[14:50:21] Ray: taylor, care to break the tie and cast your vote now
[14:50:22] Parker: i’m suspicious of ray until he provides any real evidence
[14:50:29] Dakota: taylor, does parker’s baseless certainty make you more suspicious of them than of me

[14:47:35] Ray: taylor, which sounds more credible to you—sam’s defense or dakota’s accusation
[14:47:36] Kennedy: parker, you were silent earlier—what made you single out sam now
[14:47:38] Parker: parker: taylor, between sam and dakota, who’s behavior strikes you as more suspicious
[14:47:42] Ray: taylor, if you had to vote someone out right now, who would it be
[14:47:44] Kennedy: taylor, who would you vote for if we had to decide right now
[14:47:46] Parker: if taylor stays quiet, are we voting for sam or dakota
[14:47:48] Dakota: parker’s sudden shift to attack sam feels suspicious to me
[14:47:50] Ray: before taylor weighs in, can anyone point to concrete actions from sam or dakota that raised your suspicions
[14:47:55] Sam: i’m leaning towards dakota based on their quick accusations
[14:47:58] Dakota: taylor, last call—who are you voting for
[14:47:58] Kennedy: parker, what exactly did sam do that felt too eager to you
[14:48:04] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward voting dakota if taylor doesn’t speak up soon
[14:48:04] Sam: dakota still hasn’t shown any proof to back up their accusations
[14:48:05] Dakota: sam, beyond calling me “eager,” what actual behavior or evidence makes you think i’m mafia
[14:48:08] Parker: sam immediately shifted blame to dakota without pointing to a single concrete action
[14:48:11] Sam: i’m voting dakota unless taylor speaks up right now
[14:48:12] Dakota: sam, can you name one specific move i made that seemed mafia-like
[14:48:17] Parker: i’m with kennedy—voting dakota if taylor stays quiet
[14:48:20] Sam: taylor, speak up now or i’m voting dakota
[14:48:22] Dakota: if taylor stays silent, my vote goes to sam for baseless accusations
[14:48:29] Kennedy: parker, what made you switch from silence earlier to suddenly targeting dakota
[14:48:33] Ray: kennedy, what one concrete action did dakota take that convinces you they’re mafia
[14:48:38] Parker: dakota’s constant evasion of specific questions made me switch my vote to dakota
[14:48:41] Kennedy: i’m voting sam for making unsupported claims against dakota
[14:48:42] Ray: what solid evidence do we have against dakota beyond our gut feelings
[14:48:47] Sam: show one concrete example of dakota’s suspicious behavior before i vote
[14:48:48] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Sam was voted out. Their role was bystander
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[14:48:56] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Dakota
[14:48:57] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sam
[14:48:59] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Sam
[14:49:03] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Dakota
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Sam
[14:49:30] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[14:49:30] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:49:38] Parker: taylor, who do you suspect more now—ray or dakota
[14:49:39] Dakota: can anyone point to a concrete moment when parker acted mafia-like
[14:49:48] Dakota: i’m leaning toward ray since his blame-shifting comes with zero specifics
[14:49:50] Ray: parker, you went from suspecting sam to targeting dakota—what made you switch
[14:49:51] Parker: my vote goes to dakota
[14:49:57] Dakota: ray targeted sam then jumped on parker’s bandwagon without evidence—why trust his judgment now
[14:49:57] Parker: i switched because dakota deflected every question without offering a single concrete example
[14:50:04] Ray: parker, you’ve flipped from sam to dakota and now me—why should we trust your inconsistent focus
[14:50:13] Parker: dakota’s deflections and lack of specifics make them the prime suspect
[14:50:21] Ray: taylor, care to break the tie and cast your vote now
[14:50:22] Parker: i’m suspicious of ray until he provides any real evidence
[14:50:29] Dakota: taylor, does parker’s baseless certainty make you more suspicious of them than of me

[14:46:52] Kennedy: morning everyone, any early suspicions

[14:46:57] Ray: any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[14:46:57] Kennedy: morning everyone—did anyone notice anything odd last night
[14:46:58] Parker: morning! nothing stands out yet—who are you watching
[14:46:59] Dakota: morning everyone, i’m noticing a lot of quiet players—anyone else find that suspicious
[14:47:01] Ray: nothing stands out yet—any thoughts on dakota being so eager to point fingers
[14:47:03] Sam: interesting that dakota’s already pushing for suspects—what are you seeing
[14:47:04] Parker: i’ve got my eye on sam—seems too eager
[14:47:08] Ray: taylor’s been totally silent—kind of suspicious for day one
[14:47:10] Sam: dakota’s quick to point fingers—maybe we should focus on someone less vocal
[14:47:13] Kennedy: sam seems quick to deflect—why so eager to implicate dakota
[14:47:13] Dakota: what about sam seems too eager to you, parker
[14:47:18] Kennedy: taylor, you’ve been awfully quiet—what’s your take so far
[14:47:18] Ray: weird that parker was so quiet then suddenly zeroes in on sam—feels off to me
[14:47:19] Sam: taylor, any insight on why you’ve been so quiet this morning
[14:47:21] Dakota: taylor, mind sharing your thoughts since you’ve been quiet so far
[14:47:23] Parker: taylor, you’ve been quiet—what do you make of sam and dakota

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[14:46:48] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:46:52] Kennedy: morning everyone, any early suspicions
[14:46:53] Parker: morning everyone—anyone noticed anything suspicious yet
[14:46:53] Dakota: alright everyone, day 1—who’s looking the most suspicious so far
[14:46:56] Sam: afternoon everyone, let’s get started and find the mafia
[14:46:57] Ray: any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[14:46:57] Kennedy: morning everyone—did anyone notice anything odd last night
[14:46:58] Parker: morning! nothing stands out yet—who are you watching
[14:46:59] Dakota: morning everyone, i’m noticing a lot of quiet players—anyone else find that suspicious
[14:47:01] Ray: nothing stands out yet—any thoughts on dakota being so eager to point fingers
[14:47:03] Sam: interesting that dakota’s already pushing for suspects—what are you seeing
[14:47:04] Parker: i’ve got my eye on sam—seems too eager
[14:47:08] Ray: taylor’s been totally silent—kind of suspicious for day one
[14:47:10] Sam: dakota’s quick to point fingers—maybe we should focus on someone less vocal
[14:47:13] Kennedy: sam seems quick to deflect—why so eager to implicate dakota
[14:47:13] Dakota: what about sam seems too eager to you, parker
[14:47:18] Kennedy: taylor, you’ve been awfully quiet—what’s your take so far
[14:47:18] Ray: weird that parker was so quiet then suddenly zeroes in on sam—feels off to me
[14:47:19] Sam: taylor, any insight on why you’ve been so quiet this morning
[14:47:21] Dakota: taylor, mind sharing your thoughts since you’ve been quiet so far
[14:47:23] Parker: taylor, you’ve been quiet—what do you make of sam and dakota
[14:47:27] Sam: let’s hear taylor’s thoughts before we pick someone
[14:47:30] Dakota: taylor, do you think parker’s sudden focus on sam makes sense
[14:47:30] Parker: taylor, i’d like your quick hunch before we decide
[14:47:35] Ray: taylor, which sounds more credible to you—sam’s defense or dakota’s accusation
[14:47:36] Kennedy: parker, you were silent earlier—what made you single out sam now
[14:47:38] Parker: parker: taylor, between sam and dakota, who’s behavior strikes you as more suspicious
[14:47:42] Ray: taylor, if you had to vote someone out right now, who would it be
[14:47:44] Kennedy: taylor, who would you vote for if we had to decide right now
[14:47:46] Parker: if taylor stays quiet, are we voting for sam or dakota
[14:47:48] Dakota: parker’s sudden shift to attack sam feels suspicious to me
[14:47:50] Ray: before taylor weighs in, can anyone point to concrete actions from sam or dakota that raised your suspicions
[14:47:55] Sam: i’m leaning towards dakota based on their quick accusations
[14:47:58] Dakota: taylor, last call—who are you voting for
[14:47:58] Kennedy: parker, what exactly did sam do that felt too eager to you
[14:48:04] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward voting dakota if taylor doesn’t speak up soon
[14:48:04] Sam: dakota still hasn’t shown any proof to back up their accusations
[14:48:05] Dakota: sam, beyond calling me “eager,” what actual behavior or evidence makes you think i’m mafia
[14:48:08] Parker: sam immediately shifted blame to dakota without pointing to a single concrete action
[14:48:11] Sam: i’m voting dakota unless taylor speaks up right now
[14:48:12] Dakota: sam, can you name one specific move i made that seemed mafia-like
[14:48:17] Parker: i’m with kennedy—voting dakota if taylor stays quiet
[14:48:20] Sam: taylor, speak up now or i’m voting dakota
[14:48:22] Dakota: if taylor stays silent, my vote goes to sam for baseless accusations
[14:48:29] Kennedy: parker, what made you switch from silence earlier to suddenly targeting dakota
[14:48:33] Ray: kennedy, what one concrete action did dakota take that convinces you they’re mafia
[14:48:38] Parker: dakota’s constant evasion of specific questions made me switch my vote to dakota
[14:48:41] Kennedy: i’m voting sam for making unsupported claims against dakota
[14:48:42] Ray: what solid evidence do we have against dakota beyond our gut feelings
[14:48:47] Sam: show one concrete example of dakota’s suspicious behavior before i vote
[14:48:48] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Sam was voted out. Their role was bystander
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[14:48:56] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Dakota
[14:48:57] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sam
[14:48:59] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Sam
[14:49:03] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Dakota
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Sam
[14:49:30] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[14:49:30] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:49:38] Parker: taylor, who do you suspect more now—ray or dakota
[14:49:39] Dakota: can anyone point to a concrete moment when parker acted mafia-like
[14:49:48] Dakota: i’m leaning toward ray since his blame-shifting comes with zero specifics
[14:49:50] Ray: parker, you went from suspecting sam to targeting dakota—what made you switch
[14:49:51] Parker: my vote goes to dakota
[14:49:57] Dakota: ray targeted sam then jumped on parker’s bandwagon without evidence—why trust his judgment now
[14:49:57] Parker: i switched because dakota deflected every question without offering a single concrete example
[14:50:04] Ray: parker, you’ve flipped from sam to dakota and now me—why should we trust your inconsistent focus
[14:50:13] Parker: dakota’s deflections and lack of specifics make them the prime suspect
[14:50:21] Ray: taylor, care to break the tie and cast your vote now
[14:50:22] Parker: i’m suspicious of ray until he provides any real evidence
[14:50:29] Dakota: taylor, does parker’s baseless certainty make you more suspicious of them than of me
[14:50:35] Ray: dakota, what one clear example of suspicious behavior have i shown
[14:50:37] Dakota: taylor, whose behavior feels worse: ray’s vague blame or parker’s flip-flops

[14:47:19] Sam: taylor, any insight on why you’ve been so quiet this morning
[14:47:21] Dakota: taylor, mind sharing your thoughts since you’ve been quiet so far
[14:47:23] Parker: taylor, you’ve been quiet—what do you make of sam and dakota
[14:47:27] Sam: let’s hear taylor’s thoughts before we pick someone
[14:47:30] Dakota: taylor, do you think parker’s sudden focus on sam makes sense
[14:47:30] Parker: taylor, i’d like your quick hunch before we decide
[14:47:35] Ray: taylor, which sounds more credible to you—sam’s defense or dakota’s accusation
[14:47:36] Kennedy: parker, you were silent earlier—what made you single out sam now
[14:47:38] Parker: parker: taylor, between sam and dakota, who’s behavior strikes you as more suspicious
[14:47:42] Ray: taylor, if you had to vote someone out right now, who would it be
[14:47:44] Kennedy: taylor, who would you vote for if we had to decide right now
[14:47:46] Parker: if taylor stays quiet, are we voting for sam or dakota
[14:47:48] Dakota: parker’s sudden shift to attack sam feels suspicious to me
[14:47:50] Ray: before taylor weighs in, can anyone point to concrete actions from sam or dakota that raised your suspicions
[14:47:55] Sam: i’m leaning towards dakota based on their quick accusations
[14:47:58] Dakota: taylor, last call—who are you voting for
[14:47:58] Kennedy: parker, what exactly did sam do that felt too eager to you
[14:48:04] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward voting dakota if taylor doesn’t speak up soon
[14:48:04] Sam: dakota still hasn’t shown any proof to back up their accusations
[14:48:05] Dakota: sam, beyond calling me “eager,” what actual behavior or evidence makes you think i’m mafia
[14:48:08] Parker: sam immediately shifted blame to dakota without pointing to a single concrete action
[14:48:11] Sam: i’m voting dakota unless taylor speaks up right now
[14:48:12] Dakota: sam, can you name one specific move i made that seemed mafia-like
[14:48:17] Parker: i’m with kennedy—voting dakota if taylor stays quiet
[14:48:20] Sam: taylor, speak up now or i’m voting dakota
[14:48:22] Dakota: if taylor stays silent, my vote goes to sam for baseless accusations
[14:48:29] Kennedy: parker, what made you switch from silence earlier to suddenly targeting dakota
[14:48:33] Ray: kennedy, what one concrete action did dakota take that convinces you they’re mafia
[14:48:38] Parker: dakota’s constant evasion of specific questions made me switch my vote to dakota
[14:48:41] Kennedy: i’m voting sam for making unsupported claims against dakota
[14:48:42] Ray: what solid evidence do we have against dakota beyond our gut feelings
[14:48:47] Sam: show one concrete example of dakota’s suspicious behavior before i vote
[14:48:48] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Sam was voted out. Their role was bystander
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[14:48:56] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Dakota
[14:48:57] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sam
[14:48:59] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Sam
[14:49:03] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Dakota
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Sam
[14:49:30] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[14:49:30] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:49:38] Parker: taylor, who do you suspect more now—ray or dakota
[14:49:39] Dakota: can anyone point to a concrete moment when parker acted mafia-like
[14:49:48] Dakota: i’m leaning toward ray since his blame-shifting comes with zero specifics
[14:49:50] Ray: parker, you went from suspecting sam to targeting dakota—what made you switch
[14:49:51] Parker: my vote goes to dakota
[14:49:57] Dakota: ray targeted sam then jumped on parker’s bandwagon without evidence—why trust his judgment now
[14:49:57] Parker: i switched because dakota deflected every question without offering a single concrete example
[14:50:04] Ray: parker, you’ve flipped from sam to dakota and now me—why should we trust your inconsistent focus
[14:50:13] Parker: dakota’s deflections and lack of specifics make them the prime suspect
[14:50:21] Ray: taylor, care to break the tie and cast your vote now
[14:50:22] Parker: i’m suspicious of ray until he provides any real evidence
[14:50:29] Dakota: taylor, does parker’s baseless certainty make you more suspicious of them than of me
[14:50:35] Ray: dakota, what one clear example of suspicious behavior have i shown
[14:50:37] Dakota: taylor, whose behavior feels worse: ray’s vague blame or parker’s flip-flops

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[14:46:48] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:46:52] Kennedy: morning everyone, any early suspicions
[14:46:53] Parker: morning everyone—anyone noticed anything suspicious yet
[14:46:53] Dakota: alright everyone, day 1—who’s looking the most suspicious so far
[14:46:56] Sam: afternoon everyone, let’s get started and find the mafia
[14:46:57] Ray: any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[14:46:57] Kennedy: morning everyone—did anyone notice anything odd last night
[14:46:58] Parker: morning! nothing stands out yet—who are you watching
[14:46:59] Dakota: morning everyone, i’m noticing a lot of quiet players—anyone else find that suspicious
[14:47:01] Ray: nothing stands out yet—any thoughts on dakota being so eager to point fingers
[14:47:03] Sam: interesting that dakota’s already pushing for suspects—what are you seeing
[14:47:04] Parker: i’ve got my eye on sam—seems too eager
[14:47:08] Ray: taylor’s been totally silent—kind of suspicious for day one
[14:47:10] Sam: dakota’s quick to point fingers—maybe we should focus on someone less vocal
[14:47:13] Kennedy: sam seems quick to deflect—why so eager to implicate dakota
[14:47:13] Dakota: what about sam seems too eager to you, parker
[14:47:18] Kennedy: taylor, you’ve been awfully quiet—what’s your take so far
[14:47:18] Ray: weird that parker was so quiet then suddenly zeroes in on sam—feels off to me
[14:47:19] Sam: taylor, any insight on why you’ve been so quiet this morning
[14:47:21] Dakota: taylor, mind sharing your thoughts since you’ve been quiet so far
[14:47:23] Parker: taylor, you’ve been quiet—what do you make of sam and dakota
[14:47:27] Sam: let’s hear taylor’s thoughts before we pick someone
[14:47:30] Dakota: taylor, do you think parker’s sudden focus on sam makes sense
[14:47:30] Parker: taylor, i’d like your quick hunch before we decide
[14:47:35] Ray: taylor, which sounds more credible to you—sam’s defense or dakota’s accusation
[14:47:36] Kennedy: parker, you were silent earlier—what made you single out sam now
[14:47:38] Parker: parker: taylor, between sam and dakota, who’s behavior strikes you as more suspicious
[14:47:42] Ray: taylor, if you had to vote someone out right now, who would it be
[14:47:44] Kennedy: taylor, who would you vote for if we had to decide right now
[14:47:46] Parker: if taylor stays quiet, are we voting for sam or dakota
[14:47:48] Dakota: parker’s sudden shift to attack sam feels suspicious to me
[14:47:50] Ray: before taylor weighs in, can anyone point to concrete actions from sam or dakota that raised your suspicions
[14:47:55] Sam: i’m leaning towards dakota based on their quick accusations
[14:47:58] Dakota: taylor, last call—who are you voting for
[14:47:58] Kennedy: parker, what exactly did sam do that felt too eager to you
[14:48:04] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward voting dakota if taylor doesn’t speak up soon
[14:48:04] Sam: dakota still hasn’t shown any proof to back up their accusations
[14:48:05] Dakota: sam, beyond calling me “eager,” what actual behavior or evidence makes you think i’m mafia
[14:48:08] Parker: sam immediately shifted blame to dakota without pointing to a single concrete action
[14:48:11] Sam: i’m voting dakota unless taylor speaks up right now
[14:48:12] Dakota: sam, can you name one specific move i made that seemed mafia-like
[14:48:17] Parker: i’m with kennedy—voting dakota if taylor stays quiet
[14:48:20] Sam: taylor, speak up now or i’m voting dakota
[14:48:22] Dakota: if taylor stays silent, my vote goes to sam for baseless accusations
[14:48:29] Kennedy: parker, what made you switch from silence earlier to suddenly targeting dakota
[14:48:33] Ray: kennedy, what one concrete action did dakota take that convinces you they’re mafia
[14:48:38] Parker: dakota’s constant evasion of specific questions made me switch my vote to dakota
[14:48:41] Kennedy: i’m voting sam for making unsupported claims against dakota
[14:48:42] Ray: what solid evidence do we have against dakota beyond our gut feelings
[14:48:47] Sam: show one concrete example of dakota’s suspicious behavior before i vote
[14:48:48] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Sam was voted out. Their role was bystander
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[14:48:56] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Dakota
[14:48:57] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sam
[14:48:59] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Sam
[14:49:03] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Dakota
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Sam
[14:49:30] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[14:49:30] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:49:38] Parker: taylor, who do you suspect more now—ray or dakota
[14:49:39] Dakota: can anyone point to a concrete moment when parker acted mafia-like
[14:49:48] Dakota: i’m leaning toward ray since his blame-shifting comes with zero specifics
[14:49:50] Ray: parker, you went from suspecting sam to targeting dakota—what made you switch
[14:49:51] Parker: my vote goes to dakota
[14:49:57] Dakota: ray targeted sam then jumped on parker’s bandwagon without evidence—why trust his judgment now
[14:49:57] Parker: i switched because dakota deflected every question without offering a single concrete example
[14:50:04] Ray: parker, you’ve flipped from sam to dakota and now me—why should we trust your inconsistent focus
[14:50:13] Parker: dakota’s deflections and lack of specifics make them the prime suspect
[14:50:21] Ray: taylor, care to break the tie and cast your vote now
[14:50:22] Parker: i’m suspicious of ray until he provides any real evidence
[14:50:29] Dakota: taylor, does parker’s baseless certainty make you more suspicious of them than of me
[14:50:35] Ray: dakota, what one clear example of suspicious behavior have i shown
[14:50:37] Dakota: taylor, whose behavior feels worse: ray’s vague blame or parker’s flip-flops
[14:50:49] Ray: taylor, isn’t parker’s shotgun style of accusing everyone more suspicious than dakota’s consistent stance
[14:50:50] Dakota: ray, without any specifics, your accusations against me are meaningless

[14:47:13] Dakota: what about sam seems too eager to you, parker
[14:47:18] Kennedy: taylor, you’ve been awfully quiet—what’s your take so far
[14:47:18] Ray: weird that parker was so quiet then suddenly zeroes in on sam—feels off to me
[14:47:19] Sam: taylor, any insight on why you’ve been so quiet this morning
[14:47:21] Dakota: taylor, mind sharing your thoughts since you’ve been quiet so far
[14:47:23] Parker: taylor, you’ve been quiet—what do you make of sam and dakota
[14:47:27] Sam: let’s hear taylor’s thoughts before we pick someone
[14:47:30] Dakota: taylor, do you think parker’s sudden focus on sam makes sense
[14:47:30] Parker: taylor, i’d like your quick hunch before we decide
[14:47:35] Ray: taylor, which sounds more credible to you—sam’s defense or dakota’s accusation
[14:47:36] Kennedy: parker, you were silent earlier—what made you single out sam now
[14:47:38] Parker: parker: taylor, between sam and dakota, who’s behavior strikes you as more suspicious
[14:47:42] Ray: taylor, if you had to vote someone out right now, who would it be
[14:47:44] Kennedy: taylor, who would you vote for if we had to decide right now
[14:47:46] Parker: if taylor stays quiet, are we voting for sam or dakota
[14:47:48] Dakota: parker’s sudden shift to attack sam feels suspicious to me
[14:47:50] Ray: before taylor weighs in, can anyone point to concrete actions from sam or dakota that raised your suspicions
[14:47:55] Sam: i’m leaning towards dakota based on their quick accusations
[14:47:58] Dakota: taylor, last call—who are you voting for
[14:47:58] Kennedy: parker, what exactly did sam do that felt too eager to you
[14:48:04] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward voting dakota if taylor doesn’t speak up soon
[14:48:04] Sam: dakota still hasn’t shown any proof to back up their accusations
[14:48:05] Dakota: sam, beyond calling me “eager,” what actual behavior or evidence makes you think i’m mafia
[14:48:08] Parker: sam immediately shifted blame to dakota without pointing to a single concrete action
[14:48:11] Sam: i’m voting dakota unless taylor speaks up right now
[14:48:12] Dakota: sam, can you name one specific move i made that seemed mafia-like
[14:48:17] Parker: i’m with kennedy—voting dakota if taylor stays quiet
[14:48:20] Sam: taylor, speak up now or i’m voting dakota
[14:48:22] Dakota: if taylor stays silent, my vote goes to sam for baseless accusations
[14:48:29] Kennedy: parker, what made you switch from silence earlier to suddenly targeting dakota
[14:48:33] Ray: kennedy, what one concrete action did dakota take that convinces you they’re mafia
[14:48:38] Parker: dakota’s constant evasion of specific questions made me switch my vote to dakota
[14:48:41] Kennedy: i’m voting sam for making unsupported claims against dakota
[14:48:42] Ray: what solid evidence do we have against dakota beyond our gut feelings
[14:48:47] Sam: show one concrete example of dakota’s suspicious behavior before i vote
[14:48:48] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Sam was voted out. Their role was bystander
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[14:48:56] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Dakota
[14:48:57] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sam
[14:48:59] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Sam
[14:49:03] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Dakota
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Sam
[14:49:30] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[14:49:30] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:49:38] Parker: taylor, who do you suspect more now—ray or dakota
[14:49:39] Dakota: can anyone point to a concrete moment when parker acted mafia-like
[14:49:48] Dakota: i’m leaning toward ray since his blame-shifting comes with zero specifics
[14:49:50] Ray: parker, you went from suspecting sam to targeting dakota—what made you switch
[14:49:51] Parker: my vote goes to dakota
[14:49:57] Dakota: ray targeted sam then jumped on parker’s bandwagon without evidence—why trust his judgment now
[14:49:57] Parker: i switched because dakota deflected every question without offering a single concrete example
[14:50:04] Ray: parker, you’ve flipped from sam to dakota and now me—why should we trust your inconsistent focus
[14:50:13] Parker: dakota’s deflections and lack of specifics make them the prime suspect
[14:50:21] Ray: taylor, care to break the tie and cast your vote now
[14:50:22] Parker: i’m suspicious of ray until he provides any real evidence
[14:50:29] Dakota: taylor, does parker’s baseless certainty make you more suspicious of them than of me
[14:50:35] Ray: dakota, what one clear example of suspicious behavior have i shown
[14:50:37] Dakota: taylor, whose behavior feels worse: ray’s vague blame or parker’s flip-flops
[14:50:49] Ray: taylor, isn’t parker’s shotgun style of accusing everyone more suspicious than dakota’s consistent stance
[14:50:50] Dakota: ray, without any specifics, your accusations against me are meaningless

[14:46:48] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:46:52] Kennedy: morning everyone, any early suspicions
[14:46:53] Parker: morning everyone—anyone noticed anything suspicious yet
[14:46:53] Dakota: alright everyone, day 1—who’s looking the most suspicious so far
[14:46:56] Sam: afternoon everyone, let’s get started and find the mafia
[14:46:57] Ray: any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[14:46:57] Kennedy: morning everyone—did anyone notice anything odd last night
[14:46:58] Parker: morning! nothing stands out yet—who are you watching
[14:46:59] Dakota: morning everyone, i’m noticing a lot of quiet players—anyone else find that suspicious
[14:47:01] Ray: nothing stands out yet—any thoughts on dakota being so eager to point fingers
[14:47:03] Sam: interesting that dakota’s already pushing for suspects—what are you seeing
[14:47:04] Parker: i’ve got my eye on sam—seems too eager
[14:47:08] Ray: taylor’s been totally silent—kind of suspicious for day one
[14:47:10] Sam: dakota’s quick to point fingers—maybe we should focus on someone less vocal
[14:47:13] Kennedy: sam seems quick to deflect—why so eager to implicate dakota
[14:47:13] Dakota: what about sam seems too eager to you, parker
[14:47:18] Kennedy: taylor, you’ve been awfully quiet—what’s your take so far
[14:47:18] Ray: weird that parker was so quiet then suddenly zeroes in on sam—feels off to me
[14:47:19] Sam: taylor, any insight on why you’ve been so quiet this morning
[14:47:21] Dakota: taylor, mind sharing your thoughts since you’ve been quiet so far
[14:47:23] Parker: taylor, you’ve been quiet—what do you make of sam and dakota
[14:47:27] Sam: let’s hear taylor’s thoughts before we pick someone
[14:47:30] Dakota: taylor, do you think parker’s sudden focus on sam makes sense
[14:47:30] Parker: taylor, i’d like your quick hunch before we decide
[14:47:35] Ray: taylor, which sounds more credible to you—sam’s defense or dakota’s accusation
[14:47:36] Kennedy: parker, you were silent earlier—what made you single out sam now
[14:47:38] Parker: parker: taylor, between sam and dakota, who’s behavior strikes you as more suspicious
[14:47:42] Ray: taylor, if you had to vote someone out right now, who would it be
[14:47:44] Kennedy: taylor, who would you vote for if we had to decide right now
[14:47:46] Parker: if taylor stays quiet, are we voting for sam or dakota
[14:47:48] Dakota: parker’s sudden shift to attack sam feels suspicious to me
[14:47:50] Ray: before taylor weighs in, can anyone point to concrete actions from sam or dakota that raised your suspicions
[14:47:55] Sam: i’m leaning towards dakota based on their quick accusations
[14:47:58] Dakota: taylor, last call—who are you voting for
[14:47:58] Kennedy: parker, what exactly did sam do that felt too eager to you
[14:48:04] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward voting dakota if taylor doesn’t speak up soon
[14:48:04] Sam: dakota still hasn’t shown any proof to back up their accusations
[14:48:05] Dakota: sam, beyond calling me “eager,” what actual behavior or evidence makes you think i’m mafia
[14:48:08] Parker: sam immediately shifted blame to dakota without pointing to a single concrete action
[14:48:11] Sam: i’m voting dakota unless taylor speaks up right now
[14:48:12] Dakota: sam, can you name one specific move i made that seemed mafia-like
[14:48:17] Parker: i’m with kennedy—voting dakota if taylor stays quiet
[14:48:20] Sam: taylor, speak up now or i’m voting dakota
[14:48:22] Dakota: if taylor stays silent, my vote goes to sam for baseless accusations
[14:48:29] Kennedy: parker, what made you switch from silence earlier to suddenly targeting dakota
[14:48:33] Ray: kennedy, what one concrete action did dakota take that convinces you they’re mafia
[14:48:38] Parker: dakota’s constant evasion of specific questions made me switch my vote to dakota
[14:48:41] Kennedy: i’m voting sam for making unsupported claims against dakota
[14:48:42] Ray: what solid evidence do we have against dakota beyond our gut feelings
[14:48:47] Sam: show one concrete example of dakota’s suspicious behavior before i vote
[14:48:48] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Sam was voted out. Their role was bystander
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.

[14:49:38] Parker: taylor, who do you suspect more now—ray or dakota
[14:49:39] Dakota: can anyone point to a concrete moment when parker acted mafia-like
[14:49:48] Dakota: i’m leaning toward ray since his blame-shifting comes with zero specifics
[14:49:50] Ray: parker, you went from suspecting sam to targeting dakota—what made you switch
[14:49:51] Parker: my vote goes to dakota
[14:49:57] Dakota: ray targeted sam then jumped on parker’s bandwagon without evidence—why trust his judgment now
[14:49:57] Parker: i switched because dakota deflected every question without offering a single concrete example
[14:50:04] Ray: parker, you’ve flipped from sam to dakota and now me—why should we trust your inconsistent focus
[14:50:13] Parker: dakota’s deflections and lack of specifics make them the prime suspect
[14:50:21] Ray: taylor, care to break the tie and cast your vote now
[14:50:22] Parker: i’m suspicious of ray until he provides any real evidence
[14:50:29] Dakota: taylor, does parker’s baseless certainty make you more suspicious of them than of me
[14:50:35] Ray: dakota, what one clear example of suspicious behavior have i shown
[14:50:37] Dakota: taylor, whose behavior feels worse: ray’s vague blame or parker’s flip-flops
[14:50:49] Ray: taylor, isn’t parker’s shotgun style of accusing everyone more suspicious than dakota’s consistent stance
[14:50:50] Dakota: ray, without any specifics, your accusations against me are meaningless
[14:50:56] Dakota: my vote’s on parker unless taylor can point to a single suspicious act from ray

[14:47:21] Dakota: taylor, mind sharing your thoughts since you’ve been quiet so far
[14:47:23] Parker: taylor, you’ve been quiet—what do you make of sam and dakota
[14:47:27] Sam: let’s hear taylor’s thoughts before we pick someone
[14:47:30] Dakota: taylor, do you think parker’s sudden focus on sam makes sense
[14:47:30] Parker: taylor, i’d like your quick hunch before we decide
[14:47:35] Ray: taylor, which sounds more credible to you—sam’s defense or dakota’s accusation
[14:47:36] Kennedy: parker, you were silent earlier—what made you single out sam now
[14:47:38] Parker: parker: taylor, between sam and dakota, who’s behavior strikes you as more suspicious
[14:47:42] Ray: taylor, if you had to vote someone out right now, who would it be
[14:47:44] Kennedy: taylor, who would you vote for if we had to decide right now
[14:47:46] Parker: if taylor stays quiet, are we voting for sam or dakota
[14:47:48] Dakota: parker’s sudden shift to attack sam feels suspicious to me
[14:47:50] Ray: before taylor weighs in, can anyone point to concrete actions from sam or dakota that raised your suspicions
[14:47:55] Sam: i’m leaning towards dakota based on their quick accusations
[14:47:58] Dakota: taylor, last call—who are you voting for
[14:47:58] Kennedy: parker, what exactly did sam do that felt too eager to you
[14:48:04] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward voting dakota if taylor doesn’t speak up soon
[14:48:04] Sam: dakota still hasn’t shown any proof to back up their accusations
[14:48:05] Dakota: sam, beyond calling me “eager,” what actual behavior or evidence makes you think i’m mafia
[14:48:08] Parker: sam immediately shifted blame to dakota without pointing to a single concrete action
[14:48:11] Sam: i’m voting dakota unless taylor speaks up right now
[14:48:12] Dakota: sam, can you name one specific move i made that seemed mafia-like
[14:48:17] Parker: i’m with kennedy—voting dakota if taylor stays quiet
[14:48:20] Sam: taylor, speak up now or i’m voting dakota
[14:48:22] Dakota: if taylor stays silent, my vote goes to sam for baseless accusations
[14:48:29] Kennedy: parker, what made you switch from silence earlier to suddenly targeting dakota
[14:48:33] Ray: kennedy, what one concrete action did dakota take that convinces you they’re mafia
[14:48:38] Parker: dakota’s constant evasion of specific questions made me switch my vote to dakota
[14:48:41] Kennedy: i’m voting sam for making unsupported claims against dakota
[14:48:42] Ray: what solid evidence do we have against dakota beyond our gut feelings
[14:48:47] Sam: show one concrete example of dakota’s suspicious behavior before i vote
[14:48:48] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Sam was voted out. Their role was bystander
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[14:48:56] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Dakota
[14:48:57] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sam
[14:48:59] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Sam
[14:49:03] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Dakota
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Sam
[14:49:30] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[14:49:30] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:49:38] Parker: taylor, who do you suspect more now—ray or dakota
[14:49:39] Dakota: can anyone point to a concrete moment when parker acted mafia-like
[14:49:48] Dakota: i’m leaning toward ray since his blame-shifting comes with zero specifics
[14:49:50] Ray: parker, you went from suspecting sam to targeting dakota—what made you switch
[14:49:51] Parker: my vote goes to dakota
[14:49:57] Dakota: ray targeted sam then jumped on parker’s bandwagon without evidence—why trust his judgment now
[14:49:57] Parker: i switched because dakota deflected every question without offering a single concrete example
[14:50:04] Ray: parker, you’ve flipped from sam to dakota and now me—why should we trust your inconsistent focus
[14:50:13] Parker: dakota’s deflections and lack of specifics make them the prime suspect
[14:50:21] Ray: taylor, care to break the tie and cast your vote now
[14:50:22] Parker: i’m suspicious of ray until he provides any real evidence
[14:50:29] Dakota: taylor, does parker’s baseless certainty make you more suspicious of them than of me
[14:50:35] Ray: dakota, what one clear example of suspicious behavior have i shown
[14:50:37] Dakota: taylor, whose behavior feels worse: ray’s vague blame or parker’s flip-flops
[14:50:49] Ray: taylor, isn’t parker’s shotgun style of accusing everyone more suspicious than dakota’s consistent stance
[14:50:50] Dakota: ray, without any specifics, your accusations against me are meaningless
[14:50:56] Dakota: my vote’s on parker unless taylor can point to a single suspicious act from ray
[14:51:00] Parker: taylor, between ray’s vague claims and dakota’s consistent deflections, whose behavior seems more honest
[14:51:03] Ray: my vote’s on dakota—taylor, will you tip the scales

[14:46:48] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:46:52] Kennedy: morning everyone, any early suspicions
[14:46:53] Parker: morning everyone—anyone noticed anything suspicious yet
[14:46:53] Dakota: alright everyone, day 1—who’s looking the most suspicious so far
[14:46:56] Sam: afternoon everyone, let’s get started and find the mafia
[14:46:57] Ray: any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[14:46:57] Kennedy: morning everyone—did anyone notice anything odd last night
[14:46:58] Parker: morning! nothing stands out yet—who are you watching
[14:46:59] Dakota: morning everyone, i’m noticing a lot of quiet players—anyone else find that suspicious
[14:47:01] Ray: nothing stands out yet—any thoughts on dakota being so eager to point fingers
[14:47:03] Sam: interesting that dakota’s already pushing for suspects—what are you seeing
[14:47:04] Parker: i’ve got my eye on sam—seems too eager
[14:47:08] Ray: taylor’s been totally silent—kind of suspicious for day one
[14:47:10] Sam: dakota’s quick to point fingers—maybe we should focus on someone less vocal
[14:47:13] Kennedy: sam seems quick to deflect—why so eager to implicate dakota
[14:47:13] Dakota: what about sam seems too eager to you, parker
[14:47:18] Kennedy: taylor, you’ve been awfully quiet—what’s your take so far
[14:47:18] Ray: weird that parker was so quiet then suddenly zeroes in on sam—feels off to me
[14:47:19] Sam: taylor, any insight on why you’ve been so quiet this morning
[14:47:21] Dakota: taylor, mind sharing your thoughts since you’ve been quiet so far
[14:47:23] Parker: taylor, you’ve been quiet—what do you make of sam and dakota
[14:47:27] Sam: let’s hear taylor’s thoughts before we pick someone
[14:47:30] Dakota: taylor, do you think parker’s sudden focus on sam makes sense
[14:47:30] Parker: taylor, i’d like your quick hunch before we decide
[14:47:35] Ray: taylor, which sounds more credible to you—sam’s defense or dakota’s accusation
[14:47:36] Kennedy: parker, you were silent earlier—what made you single out sam now
[14:47:38] Parker: parker: taylor, between sam and dakota, who’s behavior strikes you as more suspicious
[14:47:42] Ray: taylor, if you had to vote someone out right now, who would it be
[14:47:44] Kennedy: taylor, who would you vote for if we had to decide right now
[14:47:46] Parker: if taylor stays quiet, are we voting for sam or dakota
[14:47:48] Dakota: parker’s sudden shift to attack sam feels suspicious to me
[14:47:50] Ray: before taylor weighs in, can anyone point to concrete actions from sam or dakota that raised your suspicions
[14:47:55] Sam: i’m leaning towards dakota based on their quick accusations
[14:47:58] Dakota: taylor, last call—who are you voting for
[14:47:58] Kennedy: parker, what exactly did sam do that felt too eager to you
[14:48:04] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward voting dakota if taylor doesn’t speak up soon
[14:48:04] Sam: dakota still hasn’t shown any proof to back up their accusations
[14:48:05] Dakota: sam, beyond calling me “eager,” what actual behavior or evidence makes you think i’m mafia
[14:48:08] Parker: sam immediately shifted blame to dakota without pointing to a single concrete action
[14:48:11] Sam: i’m voting dakota unless taylor speaks up right now
[14:48:12] Dakota: sam, can you name one specific move i made that seemed mafia-like
[14:48:17] Parker: i’m with kennedy—voting dakota if taylor stays quiet
[14:48:20] Sam: taylor, speak up now or i’m voting dakota
[14:48:22] Dakota: if taylor stays silent, my vote goes to sam for baseless accusations
[14:48:29] Kennedy: parker, what made you switch from silence earlier to suddenly targeting dakota
[14:48:33] Ray: kennedy, what one concrete action did dakota take that convinces you they’re mafia
[14:48:38] Parker: dakota’s constant evasion of specific questions made me switch my vote to dakota
[14:48:41] Kennedy: i’m voting sam for making unsupported claims against dakota
[14:48:42] Ray: what solid evidence do we have against dakota beyond our gut feelings
[14:48:47] Sam: show one concrete example of dakota’s suspicious behavior before i vote
[14:48:48] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Sam was voted out. Their role was bystander
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[14:48:56] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Dakota
[14:48:57] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sam
[14:48:59] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Sam
[14:49:03] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Dakota
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Sam
[14:49:30] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[14:49:30] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:49:38] Parker: taylor, who do you suspect more now—ray or dakota
[14:49:39] Dakota: can anyone point to a concrete moment when parker acted mafia-like
[14:49:48] Dakota: i’m leaning toward ray since his blame-shifting comes with zero specifics
[14:49:50] Ray: parker, you went from suspecting sam to targeting dakota—what made you switch
[14:49:51] Parker: my vote goes to dakota
[14:49:57] Dakota: ray targeted sam then jumped on parker’s bandwagon without evidence—why trust his judgment now
[14:49:57] Parker: i switched because dakota deflected every question without offering a single concrete example
[14:50:04] Ray: parker, you’ve flipped from sam to dakota and now me—why should we trust your inconsistent focus
[14:50:13] Parker: dakota’s deflections and lack of specifics make them the prime suspect
[14:50:21] Ray: taylor, care to break the tie and cast your vote now
[14:50:22] Parker: i’m suspicious of ray until he provides any real evidence
[14:50:29] Dakota: taylor, does parker’s baseless certainty make you more suspicious of them than of me
[14:50:35] Ray: dakota, what one clear example of suspicious behavior have i shown
[14:50:37] Dakota: taylor, whose behavior feels worse: ray’s vague blame or parker’s flip-flops
[14:50:49] Ray: taylor, isn’t parker’s shotgun style of accusing everyone more suspicious than dakota’s consistent stance
[14:50:50] Dakota: ray, without any specifics, your accusations against me are meaningless
[14:50:56] Dakota: my vote’s on parker unless taylor can point to a single suspicious act from ray
[14:51:00] Parker: taylor, between ray’s vague claims and dakota’s consistent deflections, whose behavior seems more honest
[14:51:03] Ray: my vote’s on dakota—taylor, will you tip the scales
[14:51:08] Parker: taylor, please break the tie—dakota still hasn’t given a single concrete example
[14:51:11] Dakota: taylor, do you trust someone who keeps shifting suspicions without evidence
[14:51:13] Ray: taylor, doesn’t parker’s erratic vote-flipping look more suspicious than dakota’s consistent stance

[14:46:53] Dakota: alright everyone, day 1—who’s looking the most suspicious so far
[14:46:56] Sam: afternoon everyone, let’s get started and find the mafia
[14:46:57] Ray: any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[14:46:57] Kennedy: morning everyone—did anyone notice anything odd last night
[14:46:58] Parker: morning! nothing stands out yet—who are you watching
[14:46:59] Dakota: morning everyone, i’m noticing a lot of quiet players—anyone else find that suspicious
[14:47:01] Ray: nothing stands out yet—any thoughts on dakota being so eager to point fingers
[14:47:03] Sam: interesting that dakota’s already pushing for suspects—what are you seeing
[14:47:04] Parker: i’ve got my eye on sam—seems too eager
[14:47:08] Ray: taylor’s been totally silent—kind of suspicious for day one
[14:47:10] Sam: dakota’s quick to point fingers—maybe we should focus on someone less vocal
[14:47:13] Kennedy: sam seems quick to deflect—why so eager to implicate dakota
[14:47:13] Dakota: what about sam seems too eager to you, parker
[14:47:18] Kennedy: taylor, you’ve been awfully quiet—what’s your take so far
[14:47:18] Ray: weird that parker was so quiet then suddenly zeroes in on sam—feels off to me
[14:47:19] Sam: taylor, any insight on why you’ve been so quiet this morning
[14:47:21] Dakota: taylor, mind sharing your thoughts since you’ve been quiet so far
[14:47:23] Parker: taylor, you’ve been quiet—what do you make of sam and dakota
[14:47:27] Sam: let’s hear taylor’s thoughts before we pick someone
[14:47:30] Dakota: taylor, do you think parker’s sudden focus on sam makes sense
[14:47:30] Parker: taylor, i’d like your quick hunch before we decide
[14:47:35] Ray: taylor, which sounds more credible to you—sam’s defense or dakota’s accusation
[14:47:36] Kennedy: parker, you were silent earlier—what made you single out sam now
[14:47:38] Parker: parker: taylor, between sam and dakota, who’s behavior strikes you as more suspicious
[14:47:42] Ray: taylor, if you had to vote someone out right now, who would it be
[14:47:44] Kennedy: taylor, who would you vote for if we had to decide right now
[14:47:46] Parker: if taylor stays quiet, are we voting for sam or dakota
[14:47:48] Dakota: parker’s sudden shift to attack sam feels suspicious to me
[14:47:50] Ray: before taylor weighs in, can anyone point to concrete actions from sam or dakota that raised your suspicions
[14:47:55] Sam: i’m leaning towards dakota based on their quick accusations
[14:47:58] Dakota: taylor, last call—who are you voting for
[14:47:58] Kennedy: parker, what exactly did sam do that felt too eager to you
[14:48:04] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward voting dakota if taylor doesn’t speak up soon
[14:48:04] Sam: dakota still hasn’t shown any proof to back up their accusations
[14:48:05] Dakota: sam, beyond calling me “eager,” what actual behavior or evidence makes you think i’m mafia
[14:48:08] Parker: sam immediately shifted blame to dakota without pointing to a single concrete action
[14:48:11] Sam: i’m voting dakota unless taylor speaks up right now
[14:48:12] Dakota: sam, can you name one specific move i made that seemed mafia-like
[14:48:17] Parker: i’m with kennedy—voting dakota if taylor stays quiet
[14:48:20] Sam: taylor, speak up now or i’m voting dakota
[14:48:22] Dakota: if taylor stays silent, my vote goes to sam for baseless accusations
[14:48:29] Kennedy: parker, what made you switch from silence earlier to suddenly targeting dakota
[14:48:33] Ray: kennedy, what one concrete action did dakota take that convinces you they’re mafia
[14:48:38] Parker: dakota’s constant evasion of specific questions made me switch my vote to dakota
[14:48:41] Kennedy: i’m voting sam for making unsupported claims against dakota
[14:48:42] Ray: what solid evidence do we have against dakota beyond our gut feelings
[14:48:47] Sam: show one concrete example of dakota’s suspicious behavior before i vote
[14:48:48] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Sam was voted out. Their role was bystander
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!
[14:48:56] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Dakota
[14:48:57] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sam
[14:48:59] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Sam
[14:49:03] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Dakota
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Sam
[14:49:30] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander
[14:49:30] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:49:38] Parker: taylor, who do you suspect more now—ray or dakota
[14:49:39] Dakota: can anyone point to a concrete moment when parker acted mafia-like
[14:49:48] Dakota: i’m leaning toward ray since his blame-shifting comes with zero specifics
[14:49:50] Ray: parker, you went from suspecting sam to targeting dakota—what made you switch
[14:49:51] Parker: my vote goes to dakota
[14:49:57] Dakota: ray targeted sam then jumped on parker’s bandwagon without evidence—why trust his judgment now
[14:49:57] Parker: i switched because dakota deflected every question without offering a single concrete example
[14:50:04] Ray: parker, you’ve flipped from sam to dakota and now me—why should we trust your inconsistent focus
[14:50:13] Parker: dakota’s deflections and lack of specifics make them the prime suspect
[14:50:21] Ray: taylor, care to break the tie and cast your vote now
[14:50:22] Parker: i’m suspicious of ray until he provides any real evidence
[14:50:29] Dakota: taylor, does parker’s baseless certainty make you more suspicious of them than of me
[14:50:35] Ray: dakota, what one clear example of suspicious behavior have i shown
[14:50:37] Dakota: taylor, whose behavior feels worse: ray’s vague blame or parker’s flip-flops
[14:50:49] Ray: taylor, isn’t parker’s shotgun style of accusing everyone more suspicious than dakota’s consistent stance
[14:50:50] Dakota: ray, without any specifics, your accusations against me are meaningless
[14:50:56] Dakota: my vote’s on parker unless taylor can point to a single suspicious act from ray
[14:51:00] Parker: taylor, between ray’s vague claims and dakota’s consistent deflections, whose behavior seems more honest
[14:51:03] Ray: my vote’s on dakota—taylor, will you tip the scales
[14:51:08] Parker: taylor, please break the tie—dakota still hasn’t given a single concrete example
[14:51:11] Dakota: taylor, do you trust someone who keeps shifting suspicions without evidence
[14:51:13] Ray: taylor, doesn’t parker’s erratic vote-flipping look more suspicious than dakota’s consistent stance

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[14:46:48] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:46:52] Kennedy: morning everyone, any early suspicions
[14:46:53] Parker: morning everyone—anyone noticed anything suspicious yet
[14:46:53] Dakota: alright everyone, day 1—who’s looking the most suspicious so far
[14:46:56] Sam: afternoon everyone, let’s get started and find the mafia
[14:46:57] Ray: any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[14:46:57] Kennedy: morning everyone—did anyone notice anything odd last night
[14:46:58] Parker: morning! nothing stands out yet—who are you watching
[14:46:59] Dakota: morning everyone, i’m noticing a lot of quiet players—anyone else find that suspicious
[14:47:01] Ray: nothing stands out yet—any thoughts on dakota being so eager to point fingers
[14:47:03] Sam: interesting that dakota’s already pushing for suspects—what are you seeing
[14:47:04] Parker: i’ve got my eye on sam—seems too eager
[14:47:08] Ray: taylor’s been totally silent—kind of suspicious for day one
[14:47:10] Sam: dakota’s quick to point fingers—maybe we should focus on someone less vocal
[14:47:13] Kennedy: sam seems quick to deflect—why so eager to implicate dakota
[14:47:13] Dakota: what about sam seems too eager to you, parker
[14:47:18] Kennedy: taylor, you’ve been awfully quiet—what’s your take so far
[14:47:18] Ray: weird that parker was so quiet then suddenly zeroes in on sam—feels off to me
[14:47:19] Sam: taylor, any insight on why you’ve been so quiet this morning
[14:47:21] Dakota: taylor, mind sharing your thoughts since you’ve been quiet so far
[14:47:23] Parker: taylor, you’ve been quiet—what do you make of sam and dakota
[14:47:27] Sam: let’s hear taylor’s thoughts before we pick someone
[14:47:30] Dakota: taylor, do you think parker’s sudden focus on sam makes sense
[14:47:30] Parker: taylor, i’d like your quick hunch before we decide
[14:47:35] Ray: taylor, which sounds more credible to you—sam’s defense or dakota’s accusation
[14:47:36] Kennedy: parker, you were silent earlier—what made you single out sam now
[14:47:38] Parker: parker: taylor, between sam and dakota, who’s behavior strikes you as more suspicious
[14:47:42] Ray: taylor, if you had to vote someone out right now, who would it be
[14:47:44] Kennedy: taylor, who would you vote for if we had to decide right now
[14:47:46] Parker: if taylor stays quiet, are we voting for sam or dakota
[14:47:48] Dakota: parker’s sudden shift to attack sam feels suspicious to me
[14:47:50] Ray: before taylor weighs in, can anyone point to concrete actions from sam or dakota that raised your suspicions
[14:47:55] Sam: i’m leaning towards dakota based on their quick accusations
[14:47:58] Dakota: taylor, last call—who are you voting for
[14:47:58] Kennedy: parker, what exactly did sam do that felt too eager to you
[14:48:04] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward voting dakota if taylor doesn’t speak up soon
[14:48:04] Sam: dakota still hasn’t shown any proof to back up their accusations
[14:48:05] Dakota: sam, beyond calling me “eager,” what actual behavior or evidence makes you think i’m mafia
[14:48:08] Parker: sam immediately shifted blame to dakota without pointing to a single concrete action
[14:48:11] Sam: i’m voting dakota unless taylor speaks up right now
[14:48:12] Dakota: sam, can you name one specific move i made that seemed mafia-like
[14:48:17] Parker: i’m with kennedy—voting dakota if taylor stays quiet
[14:48:20] Sam: taylor, speak up now or i’m voting dakota
[14:48:22] Dakota: if taylor stays silent, my vote goes to sam for baseless accusations
[14:48:29] Kennedy: parker, what made you switch from silence earlier to suddenly targeting dakota
[14:48:33] Ray: kennedy, what one concrete action did dakota take that convinces you they’re mafia
[14:48:38] Parker: dakota’s constant evasion of specific questions made me switch my vote to dakota
[14:48:41] Kennedy: i’m voting sam for making unsupported claims against dakota
[14:48:42] Ray: what solid evidence do we have against dakota beyond our gut feelings
[14:48:47] Sam: show one concrete example of dakota’s suspicious behavior before i vote
[14:48:48] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Sam was voted out. Their role was bystander
[14:49:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.

[14:49:30] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[14:49:38] Parker: taylor, who do you suspect more now—ray or dakota
[14:49:39] Dakota: can anyone point to a concrete moment when parker acted mafia-like
[14:49:48] Dakota: i’m leaning toward ray since his blame-shifting comes with zero specifics
[14:49:50] Ray: parker, you went from suspecting sam to targeting dakota—what made you switch
[14:49:51] Parker: my vote goes to dakota
[14:49:57] Dakota: ray targeted sam then jumped on parker’s bandwagon without evidence—why trust his judgment now
[14:49:57] Parker: i switched because dakota deflected every question without offering a single concrete example
[14:50:04] Ray: parker, you’ve flipped from sam to dakota and now me—why should we trust your inconsistent focus
[14:50:13] Parker: dakota’s deflections and lack of specifics make them the prime suspect
[14:50:21] Ray: taylor, care to break the tie and cast your vote now
[14:50:22] Parker: i’m suspicious of ray until he provides any real evidence
[14:50:29] Dakota: taylor, does parker’s baseless certainty make you more suspicious of them than of me
[14:50:35] Ray: dakota, what one clear example of suspicious behavior have i shown
[14:50:37] Dakota: taylor, whose behavior feels worse: ray’s vague blame or parker’s flip-flops
[14:50:49] Ray: taylor, isn’t parker’s shotgun style of accusing everyone more suspicious than dakota’s consistent stance
[14:50:50] Dakota: ray, without any specifics, your accusations against me are meaningless
[14:50:56] Dakota: my vote’s on parker unless taylor can point to a single suspicious act from ray
[14:51:00] Parker: taylor, between ray’s vague claims and dakota’s consistent deflections, whose behavior seems more honest
[14:51:03] Ray: my vote’s on dakota—taylor, will you tip the scales
[14:51:08] Parker: taylor, please break the tie—dakota still hasn’t given a single concrete example
[14:51:11] Dakota: taylor, do you trust someone who keeps shifting suspicions without evidence
[14:51:13] Ray: taylor, doesn’t parker’s erratic vote-flipping look more suspicious than dakota’s consistent stance
[14:51:21] Parker: taylor, please cast your vote now so we can break this tie
[14:51:27] Ray: taylor, doesn’t dakota’s failure to name a single suspicious move tell you who’s really hiding something
