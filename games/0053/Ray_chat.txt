[14:46:57] Ray: any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[14:47:01] Ray: nothing stands out yet—any thoughts on dakota being so eager to point fingers
[14:47:08] Ray: taylor’s been totally silent—kind of suspicious for day one
[14:47:18] Ray: weird that parker was so quiet then suddenly zeroes in on sam—feels off to me
[14:47:35] Ray: taylor, which sounds more credible to you—sam’s defense or dakota’s accusation
[14:47:42] Ray: taylor, if you had to vote someone out right now, who would it be
[14:47:50] Ray: before taylor weighs in, can anyone point to concrete actions from sam or dakota that raised your suspicions
[14:48:33] Ray: kennedy, what one concrete action did dakota take that convinces you they’re mafia
[14:48:42] Ray: what solid evidence do we have against dakota beyond our gut feelings
[14:49:50] Ray: parker, you went from suspecting sam to targeting dakota—what made you switch
[14:50:04] Ray: parker, you’ve flipped from sam to dakota and now me—why should we trust your inconsistent focus
[14:50:21] Ray: taylor, care to break the tie and cast your vote now
[14:50:35] Ray: dakota, what one clear example of suspicious behavior have i shown
[14:50:49] Ray: taylor, isn’t parker’s shotgun style of accusing everyone more suspicious than dakota’s consistent stance
[14:51:03] Ray: my vote’s on dakota—taylor, will you tip the scales
[14:51:13] Ray: taylor, doesn’t parker’s erratic vote-flipping look more suspicious than dakota’s consistent stance
[14:51:27] Ray: taylor, doesn’t dakota’s failure to name a single suspicious move tell you who’s really hiding something
