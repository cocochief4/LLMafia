[14:46:53] Parker: morning everyone—anyone noticed anything suspicious yet
[14:46:58] Parker: morning! nothing stands out yet—who are you watching
[14:47:04] Parker: i’ve got my eye on sam—seems too eager
[14:47:23] Parker: taylor, you’ve been quiet—what do you make of sam and dakota
[14:47:30] Parker: taylor, i’d like your quick hunch before we decide
[14:47:38] Parker: parker: taylor, between sam and dakota, who’s behavior strikes you as more suspicious
[14:47:46] Parker: if taylor stays quiet, are we voting for sam or dakota
[14:48:08] Parker: sam immediately shifted blame to dakota without pointing to a single concrete action
[14:48:17] Parker: i’m with kennedy—voting dakota if taylor stays quiet
[14:48:38] Parker: dakota’s constant evasion of specific questions made me switch my vote to dakota
[14:49:38] Parker: taylor, who do you suspect more now—ray or dakota
[14:49:51] Parker: my vote goes to dakota
[14:49:57] Parker: i switched because dakota deflected every question without offering a single concrete example
[14:50:13] Parker: dakota’s deflections and lack of specifics make them the prime suspect
[14:50:22] Parker: i’m suspicious of ray until he provides any real evidence
[14:51:00] Parker: taylor, between ray’s vague claims and dakota’s consistent deflections, whose behavior seems more honest
[14:51:08] Parker: taylor, please break the tie—dakota still hasn’t given a single concrete example
[14:51:21] Parker: taylor, please cast your vote now so we can break this tie
