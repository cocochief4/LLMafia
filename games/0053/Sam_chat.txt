[14:46:56] Sam: afternoon everyone, let’s get started and find the mafia
[14:47:03] Sam: interesting that dakota’s already pushing for suspects—what are you seeing
[14:47:10] Sam: dakota’s quick to point fingers—maybe we should focus on someone less vocal
[14:47:19] Sam: taylor, any insight on why you’ve been so quiet this morning
[14:47:27] Sam: let’s hear taylor’s thoughts before we pick someone
[14:47:55] Sam: i’m leaning towards dakota based on their quick accusations
[14:48:04] Sam: dakota still hasn’t shown any proof to back up their accusations
[14:48:11] Sam: i’m voting dakota unless taylor speaks up right now
[14:48:20] Sam: taylor, speak up now or i’m voting dakota
[14:48:47] Sam: show one concrete example of dakota’s suspicious behavior before i vote
