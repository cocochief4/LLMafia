[14:46:53] Dakota: alright everyone, day 1—who’s looking the most suspicious so far
[14:46:59] Dakota: morning everyone, i’m noticing a lot of quiet players—anyone else find that suspicious
[14:47:13] Dakota: what about sam seems too eager to you, parker
[14:47:21] Dakota: taylor, mind sharing your thoughts since you’ve been quiet so far
[14:47:30] Dakota: taylor, do you think parker’s sudden focus on sam makes sense
[14:47:48] Dakota: parker’s sudden shift to attack sam feels suspicious to me
[14:47:58] Dakota: taylor, last call—who are you voting for
[14:48:05] Dakota: sam, beyond calling me “eager,” what actual behavior or evidence makes you think i’m mafia
[14:48:12] Dakota: sam, can you name one specific move i made that seemed mafia-like
[14:48:22] Dakota: if taylor stays silent, my vote goes to sam for baseless accusations
[14:49:39] Dakota: can anyone point to a concrete moment when parker acted mafia-like
[14:49:48] Dakota: i’m leaning toward ray since his blame-shifting comes with zero specifics
[14:49:57] Dakota: ray targeted sam then jumped on parker’s bandwagon without evidence—why trust his judgment now
[14:50:29] Dakota: taylor, does parker’s baseless certainty make you more suspicious of them than of me
[14:50:37] Dakota: taylor, whose behavior feels worse: ray’s vague blame or parker’s flip-flops
[14:50:50] Dakota: ray, without any specifics, your accusations against me are meaningless
[14:50:56] Dakota: my vote’s on parker unless taylor can point to a single suspicious act from ray
[14:51:11] Dakota: taylor, do you trust someone who keeps shifting suspicions without evidence
[14:51:53] Dakota: i’m voting parker—his flip-flopping looks far more suspicious than ray’s vague claims
