[14:46:52] Kennedy: morning everyone, any early suspicions
[14:46:57] Kennedy: morning everyone—did anyone notice anything odd last night
[14:47:13] Kennedy: sam seems quick to deflect—why so eager to implicate dakota
[14:47:18] Kennedy: taylor, you’ve been awfully quiet—what’s your take so far
[14:47:36] Kennedy: parker, you were silent earlier—what made you single out sam now
[14:47:44] Kennedy: taylor, who would you vote for if we had to decide right now
[14:47:58] Kennedy: parker, what exactly did sam do that felt too eager to you
[14:48:04] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward voting dakota if taylor doesn’t speak up soon
[14:48:29] Kennedy: parker, what made you switch from silence earlier to suddenly targeting dakota
[14:48:41] Kennedy: i’m voting sam for making unsupported claims against dakota
