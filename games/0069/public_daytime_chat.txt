[16:31:25] Parker: hey everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[16:31:26] Kennedy: anyone have initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[16:31:26] Sam: any thoughts on who was unusually quiet last night
[16:31:28] Dakota: morning everyone—any initial gut feelings on who might be mafia
[16:31:30] Ray: anyone else find sam's silence so far odd
[16:31:33] Parker: any early reads on someone’s behavior so far
[16:31:34] Kennedy: i’m a bit suspicious of sam’s quietness—any thoughts
[16:31:35] Sam: i’m leaning toward ray—he’s been awfully quiet
[16:31:36] Dakota: ray was super quiet last night—does anyone else find that suspicious
[16:31:37] Ray: dakota was the first to chime in—does that strike anyone as odd
[16:31:43] Kennedy: ray, what’s your reasoning for zeroing in on sam’s silence so quickly
[16:31:46] Ray: does anyone else feel sam’s sudden accusation might be a deflection tactic
[16:31:50] Dakota: what makes you suspicious of ray’s quietness, sam
[16:31:51] Sam: i noticed parker got oddly defensive when i brought it up—thoughts
[16:31:54] Kennedy: does it seem odd that parker keeps asking questions but hasn’t taken a clear stance
[16:31:54] Parker: ray, what specifically about sam’s silence seems off to you
[16:31:55] Ray: i noticed everyone else was tossing out ideas but sam stayed silent, and that seemed odd
[16:31:59] Sam: because mafia often keep quiet to avoid attention, and ray’s silence fits that pattern
[16:32:01] Dakota: can someone share a specific moment that made them suspect sam or ray
[16:32:06] Ray: he didn’t say a word until prodded, unlike the rest of us
[16:32:06] Parker: i’m leaning toward ray—his sudden defensiveness after everyone pointed at him seems off
[16:32:12] Sam: parker, you’ve asked a lot of questions but still haven’t picked anyone to vote—why
[16:32:15] Parker: sam, beyond ray’s silence, what other red flag have you picked up on
[16:32:16] Kennedy: i noticed sam accused ray of being quiet last night without any concrete example, which felt vague
[16:32:20] Dakota: parker, can you point out exactly what ray said that came off as defensive
[16:32:23] Parker: i’ll wait for alibis but ray’s defensiveness is still my main concern
[16:32:24] Sam: ray, can you explain why you were so silent earlier
[16:32:26] Kennedy: parker, instead of grilling sam, who are you voting for right now
[16:32:31] Ray: kennedy, you’ve echoed everyone’s points but offered no fresh insight—how does that prove you’re not hiding something
[16:32:34] Dakota: parker, why did you pivot from asking questions to voting for ray without any concrete proof
[16:32:35] Kennedy: okay, let’s vote—who’s voting for ray right now
[16:32:36] Parker: he accused my line of questioning as a deflection instead of explaining his own silence
[16:32:42] Sam: dakota, ray calling my accusation a "deflection tactic" within seconds struck me as suspicious
[16:32:43] Dakota: kennedy, can you share a concrete observation you’ve made instead of echoing someone else
[16:32:49] Parker: i’m voting ray since he still hasn’t backed up his accusations or explained his own silence
[16:32:51] Ray: i’m voting sam—his vague accusations aren’t convincing me
[16:32:57] Dakota: kennedy, what’s your fresh insight beyond echoing everyone else
[16:33:01] Sam: i’m sticking with ray unless someone provides a concrete reason to change my vote
[16:33:11] Kennedy: ray attacked my approach rather than offering an alibi for his unexplained silence, which struck me as suspicious
[16:33:15] Sam: parker, which of ray’s exact words felt defensive to you
[16:33:16] Ray: parker, what specific fact makes you certain i’m mafia
[16:33:19] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
