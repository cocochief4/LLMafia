[16:31:26] Sam: any thoughts on who was unusually quiet last night
[16:31:35] Sam: i’m leaning toward ray—he’s been awfully quiet
[16:31:51] Sam: i noticed parker got oddly defensive when i brought it up—thoughts
[16:31:59] Sam: because mafia often keep quiet to avoid attention, and ray’s silence fits that pattern
[16:32:12] Sam: parker, you’ve asked a lot of questions but still haven’t picked anyone to vote—why
[16:32:24] Sam: ray, can you explain why you were so silent earlier
[16:32:42] Sam: dakota, ray calling my accusation a "deflection tactic" within seconds struck me as suspicious
[16:33:01] Sam: i’m sticking with ray unless someone provides a concrete reason to change my vote
[16:33:15] Sam: parker, which of ray’s exact words felt defensive to you
[16:33:51] Sam: i’m voting ray
