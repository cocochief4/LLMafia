[16:31:26] Kennedy: anyone have initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[16:31:34] Kennedy: i’m a bit suspicious of sam’s quietness—any thoughts
[16:31:43] Kennedy: ray, what’s your reasoning for zeroing in on sam’s silence so quickly
[16:31:54] Kennedy: does it seem odd that parker keeps asking questions but hasn’t taken a clear stance
[16:32:16] Kennedy: i noticed sam accused ray of being quiet last night without any concrete example, which felt vague
[16:32:26] Kennedy: parker, instead of grilling sam, who are you voting for right now
[16:32:35] Kennedy: okay, let’s vote—who’s voting for ray right now
[16:33:11] Kennedy: ray attacked my approach rather than offering an alibi for his unexplained silence, which struck me as suspicious
[16:33:58] Kennedy: i’m voting ray—he still hasn’t given a clear alibi for his silence
