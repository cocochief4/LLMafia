## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you must explain your reasoning behind your words and actions. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to explain your reasoning before you respond.
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.

[16:31:25] Parker: hey everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[16:31:26] Kennedy: anyone have initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[16:31:26] Sam: any thoughts on who was unusually quiet last night
[16:31:28] Dakota: morning everyone—any initial gut feelings on who might be mafia
[16:31:30] Ray: anyone else find sam's silence so far odd
[16:31:33] Parker: any early reads on someone’s behavior so far
[16:31:34] Kennedy: i’m a bit suspicious of sam’s quietness—any thoughts
[16:31:35] Sam: i’m leaning toward ray—he’s been awfully quiet
[16:31:36] Dakota: ray was super quiet last night—does anyone else find that suspicious
[16:31:37] Ray: dakota was the first to chime in—does that strike anyone as odd
[16:31:43] Kennedy: ray, what’s your reasoning for zeroing in on sam’s silence so quickly
[16:31:46] Ray: does anyone else feel sam’s sudden accusation might be a deflection tactic
[16:31:50] Dakota: what makes you suspicious of ray’s quietness, sam
[16:31:51] Sam: i noticed parker got oddly defensive when i brought it up—thoughts
[16:31:54] Kennedy: does it seem odd that parker keeps asking questions but hasn’t taken a clear stance
[16:31:54] Parker: ray, what specifically about sam’s silence seems off to you
[16:31:55] Ray: i noticed everyone else was tossing out ideas but sam stayed silent, and that seemed odd
[16:31:59] Sam: because mafia often keep quiet to avoid attention, and ray’s silence fits that pattern
[16:32:01] Dakota: can someone share a specific moment that made them suspect sam or ray
[16:32:06] Ray: he didn’t say a word until prodded, unlike the rest of us
[16:32:06] Parker: i’m leaning toward ray—his sudden defensiveness after everyone pointed at him seems off

Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players!

## CONTENT: Your name is Dakota.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:31:19].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray 
 Parker 
 Sam 
 Kennedy 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Ray 
 Parker 
 Sam 
 Kennedy 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you must explain your reasoning behind your words and actions. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to explain your reasoning before you respond.
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

## CONTENT: Your name is Dakota.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:31:19].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray 
 Parker 
 Sam 
 Kennedy 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Ray

 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you must explain your reasoning behind your words and actions. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to explain your reasoning before you respond.
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[16:31:25] Parker: hey everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[16:31:26] Kennedy: anyone have initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[16:31:26] Sam: any thoughts on who was unusually quiet last night
[16:31:28] Dakota: morning everyone—any initial gut feelings on who might be mafia
[16:31:30] Ray: anyone else find sam's silence so far odd
[16:31:33] Parker: any early reads on someone’s behavior so far
[16:31:34] Kennedy: i’m a bit suspicious of sam’s quietness—any thoughts
[16:31:35] Sam: i’m leaning toward ray—he’s been awfully quiet
[16:31:36] Dakota: ray was super quiet last night—does anyone else find that suspicious
[16:31:37] Ray: dakota was the first to chime in—does that strike anyone as odd
[16:31:43] Kennedy: ray, what’s your reasoning for zeroing in on sam’s silence so quickly
[16:31:46] Ray: does anyone else feel sam’s sudden accusation might be a deflection tactic
[16:31:50] Dakota: what makes you suspicious of ray’s quietness, sam
[16:31:51] Sam: i noticed parker got oddly defensive when i brought it up—thoughts
[16:31:54] Kennedy: does it seem odd that parker keeps asking questions but hasn’t taken a clear stance
[16:31:54] Parker: ray, what specifically about sam’s silence seems off to you
[16:31:55] Ray: i noticed everyone else was tossing out ideas but sam stayed silent, and that seemed odd
[16:31:59] Sam: because mafia often keep quiet to avoid attention, and ray’s silence fits that pattern
[16:32:01] Dakota: can someone share a specific moment that made them suspect sam or ray
[16:32:06] Ray: he didn’t say a word until prodded, unlike the rest of us

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[16:31:19] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:31:25] Parker: hey everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[16:31:26] Kennedy: anyone have initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[16:31:26] Sam: any thoughts on who was unusually quiet last night
[16:31:28] Dakota: morning everyone—any initial gut feelings on who might be mafia
[16:31:30] Ray: anyone else find sam's silence so far odd
[16:31:33] Parker: any early reads on someone’s behavior so far
[16:31:34] Kennedy: i’m a bit suspicious of sam’s quietness—any thoughts
[16:31:35] Sam: i’m leaning toward ray—he’s been awfully quiet
[16:31:36] Dakota: ray was super quiet last night—does anyone else find that suspicious
[16:31:37] Ray: dakota was the first to chime in—does that strike anyone as odd
[16:31:43] Kennedy: ray, what’s your reasoning for zeroing in on sam’s silence so quickly
[16:31:46] Ray: does anyone else feel sam’s sudden accusation might be a deflection tactic
[16:31:50] Dakota: what makes you suspicious of ray’s quietness, sam
[16:31:51] Sam: i noticed parker got oddly defensive when i brought it up—thoughts
[16:31:54] Kennedy: does it seem odd that parker keeps asking questions but hasn’t taken a clear stance
[16:31:54] Parker: ray, what specifically about sam’s silence seems off to you
[16:31:55] Ray: i noticed everyone else was tossing out ideas but sam stayed silent, and that seemed odd
[16:31:59] Sam: because mafia often keep quiet to avoid attention, and ray’s silence fits that pattern
[16:32:01] Dakota: can someone share a specific moment that made them suspect sam or ray
[16:32:06] Ray: he didn’t say a word until prodded, unlike the rest of us
[16:32:06] Parker: i’m leaning toward ray—his sudden defensiveness after everyone pointed at him seems off
[16:32:12] Sam: parker, you’ve asked a lot of questions but still haven’t picked anyone to vote—why
[16:32:15] Parker: sam, beyond ray’s silence, what other red flag have you picked up on
[16:32:16] Kennedy: i noticed sam accused ray of being quiet last night without any concrete example, which felt vague
[16:32:20] Dakota: parker, can you point out exactly what ray said that came off as defensive
[16:32:23] Parker: i’ll wait for alibis but ray’s defensiveness is still my main concern
[16:32:24] Sam: ray, can you explain why you were so silent earlier
[16:32:26] Kennedy: parker, instead of grilling sam, who are you voting for right now
[16:32:31] Ray: kennedy, you’ve echoed everyone’s points but offered no fresh insight—how does that prove you’re not hiding something
[16:32:34] Dakota: parker, why did you pivot from asking questions to voting for ray without any concrete proof
[16:32:35] Kennedy: okay, let’s vote—who’s voting for ray right now
[16:32:36] Parker: he accused my line of questioning as a deflection instead of explaining his own silence
[16:32:42] Sam: dakota, ray calling my accusation a "deflection tactic" within seconds struck me as suspicious
[16:32:43] Dakota: kennedy, can you share a concrete observation you’ve made instead of echoing someone else
[16:32:49] Parker: i’m voting ray since he still hasn’t backed up his accusations or explained his own silence
[16:32:51] Ray: i’m voting sam—his vague accusations aren’t convincing me

## CONTENT: Your name is Dakota.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander.

The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[16:32:36] Parker: he accused my line of questioning as a deflection instead of explaining his own silence
[16:32:42] Sam: dakota, ray calling my accusation a "deflection tactic" within seconds struck me as suspicious
[16:32:43] Dakota: kennedy, can you share a concrete observation you’ve made instead of echoing someone else
[16:32:49] Parker: i’m voting ray since he still hasn’t backed up his accusations or explained his own silence
[16:32:51] Ray: i’m voting sam—his vague accusations aren’t convincing me
[16:32:57] Dakota: kennedy, what’s your fresh insight beyond echoing everyone else
[16:33:01] Sam: i’m sticking with ray unless someone provides a concrete reason to change my vote
[16:33:11] Kennedy: ray attacked my approach rather than offering an alibi for his unexplained silence, which struck me as suspicious
[16:33:15] Sam: parker, which of ray’s exact words felt defensive to you
[16:33:16] Ray: parker, what specific fact makes you certain i’m mafia

## CONTENT: Your name is Dakota.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:31:19].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray (mafia)
 Parker 
 Sam 
 Kennedy 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Parker 
 Sam 
 Kennedy 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you must explain your reasoning behind your words and actions. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to explain your reasoning before you respond.
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:31:19] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:31:25] Parker: hey everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[16:31:26] Kennedy: anyone have initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[16:31:26] Sam: any thoughts on who was unusually quiet last night
[16:31:28] Dakota: morning everyone—any initial gut feelings on who might be mafia
[16:31:30] Ray: anyone else find sam's silence so far odd
[16:31:33] Parker: any early reads on someone’s behavior so far
[16:31:34] Kennedy: i’m a bit suspicious of sam’s quietness—any thoughts
[16:31:35] Sam: i’m leaning toward ray—he’s been awfully quiet
[16:31:36] Dakota: ray was super quiet last night—does anyone else find that suspicious
[16:31:37] Ray: dakota was the first to chime in—does that strike anyone as odd
[16:31:43] Kennedy: ray, what’s your reasoning for zeroing in on sam’s silence so quickly
[16:31:46] Ray: does anyone else feel sam’s sudden accusation might be a deflection tactic
[16:31:50] Dakota: what makes you suspicious of ray’s quietness, sam
[16:31:51] Sam: i noticed parker got oddly defensive when i brought it up—thoughts
[16:31:54] Kennedy: does it seem odd that parker keeps asking questions but hasn’t taken a clear stance
[16:31:54] Parker: ray, what specifically about sam’s silence seems off to you
[16:31:55] Ray: i noticed everyone else was tossing out ideas but sam stayed silent, and that seemed odd
[16:31:59] Sam: because mafia often keep quiet to avoid attention, and ray’s silence fits that pattern
[16:32:01] Dakota: can someone share a specific moment that made them suspect sam or ray
[16:32:06] Ray: he didn’t say a word until prodded, unlike the rest of us
[16:32:06] Parker: i’m leaning toward ray—his sudden defensiveness after everyone pointed at him seems off
[16:32:12] Sam: parker, you’ve asked a lot of questions but still haven’t picked anyone to vote—why
[16:32:15] Parker: sam, beyond ray’s silence, what other red flag have you picked up on
[16:32:16] Kennedy: i noticed sam accused ray of being quiet last night without any concrete example, which felt vague
[16:32:20] Dakota: parker, can you point out exactly what ray said that came off as defensive
[16:32:23] Parker: i’ll wait for alibis but ray’s defensiveness is still my main concern
[16:32:24] Sam: ray, can you explain why you were so silent earlier
[16:32:26] Kennedy: parker, instead of grilling sam, who are you voting for right now
[16:32:31] Ray: kennedy, you’ve echoed everyone’s points but offered no fresh insight—how does that prove you’re not hiding something
[16:32:34] Dakota: parker, why did you pivot from asking questions to voting for ray without any concrete proof
[16:32:35] Kennedy: okay, let’s vote—who’s voting for ray right now
