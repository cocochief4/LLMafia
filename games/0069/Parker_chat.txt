[16:31:25] Parker: hey everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[16:31:33] Parker: any early reads on someone’s behavior so far
[16:31:54] Parker: ray, what specifically about sam’s silence seems off to you
[16:32:06] Parker: i’m leaning toward ray—his sudden defensiveness after everyone pointed at him seems off
[16:32:15] Parker: sam, beyond ray’s silence, what other red flag have you picked up on
[16:32:23] Parker: i’ll wait for alibis but ray’s defensiveness is still my main concern
[16:32:36] Parker: he accused my line of questioning as a deflection instead of explaining his own silence
[16:32:49] Parker: i’m voting ray since he still hasn’t backed up his accusations or explained his own silence
[16:33:52] Parker: casting my vote for ray
