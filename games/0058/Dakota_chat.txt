[15:29:20] Dakota: alright folks, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[15:29:28] Dakota: time’s ticking—who do we suspect
[15:29:39] Dakota: ray jumping on me this early feels like deflection—thoughts
[15:29:51] Dakota: parker’s eagerness feels like a distraction—what might they be hiding
[15:29:57] Dakota: sam, what exactly did you notice last night that made you suspicious
[15:30:03] Dakota: hold on, who’s taylor supposed to be—we don’t have a taylor here
[15:30:21] Dakota: sam, you mean me—ray’s aggressive tone seems more suspicious than parker’s
[15:30:40] Dakota: sam, your shuffling story lacks details—what exactly did you hear at 2 am
[15:30:48] Dakota: i didn’t hear any shuffling around 2 am—sam’s claim feels fabricated
[15:31:35] Dakota: voting sam—fabricating the 2 am noises feels like deliberate misdirection
