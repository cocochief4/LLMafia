[15:29:24] Ray: dakota’s been awfully quiet—maybe we should start there
[15:29:30] Ray: kennedy’s enthusiasm feels a bit too convenient, does anyone else find that odd
[15:29:41] Ray: sam, did you mean dakota—parker’s been suspiciously quiet too
[15:29:57] Ray: parker’s taylor comment makes no sense—who’s taylor supposed to be
[15:30:03] Ray: sam’s constant probing feels like a smokescreen
[15:30:14] Ray: sam’s the only one dragging in this phantom taylor—what are they hiding
[15:30:27] Ray: sam, were they footsteps or furniture noises
[15:30:37] Ray: sam, you’re the only one inventing a taylor—what are you hiding
[15:30:56] Ray: sam, what’s your real motive for inventing these shuffling noises
[15:31:09] Ray: since nobody else heard it, why is sam so fixated on parker’s door noises
[15:31:39] Ray: i’m voting sam since nobody else heard those supposed noises
