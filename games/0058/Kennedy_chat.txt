[15:29:22] Kennedy: alright everyone, let’s dig in and find our mafia
[15:29:29] Kennedy: i didn’t notice anything odd, but whoever’s quick to point fingers might be deflecting
[15:29:37] Kennedy: parker’s eagerness feels off—anyone else get that vibe
[15:29:46] Kennedy: taylor, you’ve been awfully quiet—what’s your take
[15:30:11] Kennedy: sam, you keep bringing up odd behavior—what exactly did you notice happening last night
[15:30:20] Kennedy: parker, care to explain the shuffling sam heard outside your door around 2 am
[15:30:30] Kennedy: parker, why was there shuffling outside your room at 2 am
[15:30:41] Kennedy: sam, can anyone else confirm hearing those noises at 2 am
[15:30:53] Kennedy: sam, was it rustling fabric or clear footsteps you heard around parker’s door at 2 am
[15:31:04] Kennedy: parker, did your door open directly onto the main hallway or into a separate area at 2 am
