[15:29:20] Dakota: alright folks, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[15:29:20] Sam: did anyone notice anything odd last night
[15:29:22] Kennedy: alright everyone, let’s dig in and find our mafia
[15:29:22] Parker: hello everyone, excited to get started—any initial gut feelings on who might be mafia
[15:29:24] Ray: dakota’s been awfully quiet—maybe we should start there
[15:29:26] Sam: taylor’s been awfully quiet so far—what’s everyone thinking
[15:29:28] Dakota: time’s ticking—who do we suspect
[15:29:29] Kennedy: i didn’t notice anything odd, but whoever’s quick to point fingers might be deflecting
[15:29:29] Parker: nothing stood out to me either—sam, what did you notice
[15:29:30] Ray: kennedy’s enthusiasm feels a bit too convenient, does anyone else find that odd
[15:29:34] Sam: dakota, what’s your take on last night’s events
[15:29:37] Kennedy: parker’s eagerness feels off—anyone else get that vibe
[15:29:39] Dakota: ray jumping on me this early feels like deflection—thoughts
[15:29:40] Parker: sam, what did taylor do that seemed odd to you
[15:29:41] Ray: sam, did you mean dakota—parker’s been suspiciously quiet too
[15:29:46] Kennedy: taylor, you’ve been awfully quiet—what’s your take
[15:29:47] Parker: ray’s rush to blame dakota seems suspicious—what’s his angle
[15:29:51] Dakota: parker’s eagerness feels like a distraction—what might they be hiding
[15:29:52] Sam: parker, you’ve barely chimed in—what’s your read on last night’s events
[15:29:55] Parker: taylor, since you’ve been quiet, what’s your read on the rest of us
[15:29:57] Ray: parker’s taylor comment makes no sense—who’s taylor supposed to be
[15:29:57] Dakota: sam, what exactly did you notice last night that made you suspicious
[15:29:59] Sam: taylor, you’ve been quiet—who do you suspect more, parker or ray
[15:30:03] Dakota: hold on, who’s taylor supposed to be—we don’t have a taylor here
[15:30:03] Ray: sam’s constant probing feels like a smokescreen
[15:30:10] Sam: i heard shuffling outside parker’s room around 2 am but they’ve given no explanation for it
[15:30:11] Kennedy: sam, you keep bringing up odd behavior—what exactly did you notice happening last night
[15:30:14] Ray: sam’s the only one dragging in this phantom taylor—what are they hiding
[15:30:20] Kennedy: parker, care to explain the shuffling sam heard outside your door around 2 am
[15:30:21] Dakota: sam, you mean me—ray’s aggressive tone seems more suspicious than parker’s
[15:30:22] Sam: there was no taylor last night—who’s planting false leads to distract us
[15:30:24] Parker: i slept the whole night—sam, what’s with your phantom taylor and those shuffling claims
[15:30:27] Ray: sam, were they footsteps or furniture noises
[15:30:30] Kennedy: parker, why was there shuffling outside your room at 2 am
[15:30:33] Parker: sam, how can you be sure those 2 am noises were outside my door and not someone else’s
[15:30:37] Ray: sam, you’re the only one inventing a taylor—what are you hiding
[15:30:39] Sam: did anyone else hear anything outside parker’s room around 2 am besides sam
[15:30:40] Dakota: sam, your shuffling story lacks details—what exactly did you hear at 2 am
[15:30:41] Kennedy: sam, can anyone else confirm hearing those noises at 2 am
[15:30:46] Parker: sam, unless someone else heard that noise, your shuffling story is a distraction
[15:30:48] Dakota: i didn’t hear any shuffling around 2 am—sam’s claim feels fabricated
[15:30:51] Sam: can anyone else vouch for parker’s whereabouts at 2am
[15:30:53] Kennedy: sam, was it rustling fabric or clear footsteps you heard around parker’s door at 2 am
[15:30:56] Ray: sam, what’s your real motive for inventing these shuffling noises
[15:30:58] Parker: can anyone else vouch for sam’s alleged noises instead of us all chasing shadows
[15:31:00] Sam: parker, does your door normally creak at night or was this noise unusual
[15:31:04] Kennedy: parker, did your door open directly onto the main hallway or into a separate area at 2 am
[15:31:09] Parker: ray, why are you so eager to discredit sam without any proof
[15:31:09] Ray: since nobody else heard it, why is sam so fixated on parker’s door noises
