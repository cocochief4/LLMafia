[15:29:20] Dakota: alright folks, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[15:29:20] Sam: did anyone notice anything odd last night
[15:29:22] Kennedy: alright everyone, let’s dig in and find our mafia
[15:29:22] Parker: hello everyone, excited to get started—any initial gut feelings on who might be mafia
[15:29:24] Ray: dakota’s been awfully quiet—maybe we should start there
[15:29:26] Sam: taylor’s been awfully quiet so far—what’s everyone thinking
[15:29:28] Dakota: time’s ticking—who do we suspect
[15:29:29] Kennedy: i didn’t notice anything odd, but whoever’s quick to point fingers might be deflecting
[15:29:29] Parker: nothing stood out to me either—sam, what did you notice
[15:29:30] Ray: kennedy’s enthusiasm feels a bit too convenient, does anyone else find that odd
[15:29:34] Sam: dakota, what’s your take on last night’s events
[15:29:37] Kennedy: parker’s eagerness feels off—anyone else get that vibe
[15:29:39] Dakota: ray jumping on me this early feels like deflection—thoughts
[15:29:40] Parker: sam, what did taylor do that seemed odd to you
[15:29:41] Ray: sam, did you mean dakota—parker’s been suspiciously quiet too
[15:29:46] Kennedy: taylor, you’ve been awfully quiet—what’s your take
[15:29:47] Parker: ray’s rush to blame dakota seems suspicious—what’s his angle
[15:29:51] Dakota: parker’s eagerness feels like a distraction—what might they be hiding
[15:29:52] Sam: parker, you’ve barely chimed in—what’s your read on last night’s events
[15:29:55] Parker: taylor, since you’ve been quiet, what’s your read on the rest of us
[15:29:57] Ray: parker’s taylor comment makes no sense—who’s taylor supposed to be
[15:29:57] Dakota: sam, what exactly did you notice last night that made you suspicious
[15:29:59] Sam: taylor, you’ve been quiet—who do you suspect more, parker or ray
[15:30:03] Dakota: hold on, who’s taylor supposed to be—we don’t have a taylor here
[15:30:03] Ray: sam’s constant probing feels like a smokescreen
[15:30:10] Sam: i heard shuffling outside parker’s room around 2 am but they’ve given no explanation for it
[15:30:11] Kennedy: sam, you keep bringing up odd behavior—what exactly did you notice happening last night
[15:30:14] Ray: sam’s the only one dragging in this phantom taylor—what are they hiding
[15:30:20] Kennedy: parker, care to explain the shuffling sam heard outside your door around 2 am
[15:30:21] Dakota: sam, you mean me—ray’s aggressive tone seems more suspicious than parker’s
[15:30:22] Sam: there was no taylor last night—who’s planting false leads to distract us
[15:30:24] Parker: i slept the whole night—sam, what’s with your phantom taylor and those shuffling claims

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

[15:29:16] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[15:29:20] Dakota: alright folks, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[15:29:20] Sam: did anyone notice anything odd last night
[15:29:22] Kennedy: alright everyone, let’s dig in and find our mafia
[15:29:22] Parker: hello everyone, excited to get started—any initial gut feelings on who might be mafia
[15:29:24] Ray: dakota’s been awfully quiet—maybe we should start there
[15:29:26] Sam: taylor’s been awfully quiet so far—what’s everyone thinking
[15:29:28] Dakota: time’s ticking—who do we suspect
[15:29:29] Kennedy: i didn’t notice anything odd, but whoever’s quick to point fingers might be deflecting
[15:29:29] Parker: nothing stood out to me either—sam, what did you notice
[15:29:30] Ray: kennedy’s enthusiasm feels a bit too convenient, does anyone else find that odd
[15:29:34] Sam: dakota, what’s your take on last night’s events
[15:29:37] Kennedy: parker’s eagerness feels off—anyone else get that vibe
[15:29:39] Dakota: ray jumping on me this early feels like deflection—thoughts
[15:29:40] Parker: sam, what did taylor do that seemed odd to you
[15:29:41] Ray: sam, did you mean dakota—parker’s been suspiciously quiet too
[15:29:46] Kennedy: taylor, you’ve been awfully quiet—what’s your take
[15:29:47] Parker: ray’s rush to blame dakota seems suspicious—what’s his angle
[15:29:51] Dakota: parker’s eagerness feels like a distraction—what might they be hiding
[15:29:52] Sam: parker, you’ve barely chimed in—what’s your read on last night’s events
[15:29:55] Parker: taylor, since you’ve been quiet, what’s your read on the rest of us
[15:29:57] Ray: parker’s taylor comment makes no sense—who’s taylor supposed to be
[15:29:57] Dakota: sam, what exactly did you notice last night that made you suspicious
[15:29:59] Sam: taylor, you’ve been quiet—who do you suspect more, parker or ray
[15:30:03] Dakota: hold on, who’s taylor supposed to be—we don’t have a taylor here
[15:30:03] Ray: sam’s constant probing feels like a smokescreen
[15:30:10] Sam: i heard shuffling outside parker’s room around 2 am but they’ve given no explanation for it
[15:30:11] Kennedy: sam, you keep bringing up odd behavior—what exactly did you notice happening last night
[15:30:14] Ray: sam’s the only one dragging in this phantom taylor—what are they hiding
[15:30:20] Kennedy: parker, care to explain the shuffling sam heard outside your door around 2 am
[15:30:21] Dakota: sam, you mean me—ray’s aggressive tone seems more suspicious than parker’s
[15:30:22] Sam: there was no taylor last night—who’s planting false leads to distract us
[15:30:24] Parker: i slept the whole night—sam, what’s with your phantom taylor and those shuffling claims
[15:30:27] Ray: sam, were they footsteps or furniture noises
[15:30:30] Kennedy: parker, why was there shuffling outside your room at 2 am
[15:30:33] Parker: sam, how can you be sure those 2 am noises were outside my door and not someone else’s
[15:30:37] Ray: sam, you’re the only one inventing a taylor—what are you hiding
[15:30:39] Sam: did anyone else hear anything outside parker’s room around 2 am besides sam
[15:30:40] Dakota: sam, your shuffling story lacks details—what exactly did you hear at 2 am

[15:29:16] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[15:29:20] Dakota: alright folks, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[15:29:20] Sam: did anyone notice anything odd last night
[15:29:22] Kennedy: alright everyone, let’s dig in and find our mafia
[15:29:22] Parker: hello everyone, excited to get started—any initial gut feelings on who might be mafia
[15:29:24] Ray: dakota’s been awfully quiet—maybe we should start there
[15:29:26] Sam: taylor’s been awfully quiet so far—what’s everyone thinking
[15:29:28] Dakota: time’s ticking—who do we suspect
[15:29:29] Kennedy: i didn’t notice anything odd, but whoever’s quick to point fingers might be deflecting
[15:29:29] Parker: nothing stood out to me either—sam, what did you notice
[15:29:30] Ray: kennedy’s enthusiasm feels a bit too convenient, does anyone else find that odd
[15:29:34] Sam: dakota, what’s your take on last night’s events
[15:29:37] Kennedy: parker’s eagerness feels off—anyone else get that vibe
[15:29:39] Dakota: ray jumping on me this early feels like deflection—thoughts
[15:29:40] Parker: sam, what did taylor do that seemed odd to you
[15:29:41] Ray: sam, did you mean dakota—parker’s been suspiciously quiet too
[15:29:46] Kennedy: taylor, you’ve been awfully quiet—what’s your take
[15:29:47] Parker: ray’s rush to blame dakota seems suspicious—what’s his angle
[15:29:51] Dakota: parker’s eagerness feels like a distraction—what might they be hiding
[15:29:52] Sam: parker, you’ve barely chimed in—what’s your read on last night’s events
[15:29:55] Parker: taylor, since you’ve been quiet, what’s your read on the rest of us
[15:29:57] Ray: parker’s taylor comment makes no sense—who’s taylor supposed to be
[15:29:57] Dakota: sam, what exactly did you notice last night that made you suspicious
[15:29:59] Sam: taylor, you’ve been quiet—who do you suspect more, parker or ray
[15:30:03] Dakota: hold on, who’s taylor supposed to be—we don’t have a taylor here
[15:30:03] Ray: sam’s constant probing feels like a smokescreen
[15:30:10] Sam: i heard shuffling outside parker’s room around 2 am but they’ve given no explanation for it
[15:30:11] Kennedy: sam, you keep bringing up odd behavior—what exactly did you notice happening last night
[15:30:14] Ray: sam’s the only one dragging in this phantom taylor—what are they hiding
[15:30:20] Kennedy: parker, care to explain the shuffling sam heard outside your door around 2 am
[15:30:21] Dakota: sam, you mean me—ray’s aggressive tone seems more suspicious than parker’s
[15:30:22] Sam: there was no taylor last night—who’s planting false leads to distract us
[15:30:24] Parker: i slept the whole night—sam, what’s with your phantom taylor and those shuffling claims
[15:30:27] Ray: sam, were they footsteps or furniture noises
[15:30:30] Kennedy: parker, why was there shuffling outside your room at 2 am
[15:30:33] Parker: sam, how can you be sure those 2 am noises were outside my door and not someone else’s
[15:30:37] Ray: sam, you’re the only one inventing a taylor—what are you hiding
[15:30:39] Sam: did anyone else hear anything outside parker’s room around 2 am besides sam
[15:30:40] Dakota: sam, your shuffling story lacks details—what exactly did you hear at 2 am
[15:30:41] Kennedy: sam, can anyone else confirm hearing those noises at 2 am
[15:30:46] Parker: sam, unless someone else heard that noise, your shuffling story is a distraction
[15:30:48] Dakota: i didn’t hear any shuffling around 2 am—sam’s claim feels fabricated

[15:29:16] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[15:29:20] Dakota: alright folks, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[15:29:20] Sam: did anyone notice anything odd last night
[15:29:22] Kennedy: alright everyone, let’s dig in and find our mafia
[15:29:22] Parker: hello everyone, excited to get started—any initial gut feelings on who might be mafia
[15:29:24] Ray: dakota’s been awfully quiet—maybe we should start there
[15:29:26] Sam: taylor’s been awfully quiet so far—what’s everyone thinking
[15:29:28] Dakota: time’s ticking—who do we suspect
[15:29:29] Kennedy: i didn’t notice anything odd, but whoever’s quick to point fingers might be deflecting
[15:29:29] Parker: nothing stood out to me either—sam, what did you notice
[15:29:30] Ray: kennedy’s enthusiasm feels a bit too convenient, does anyone else find that odd
[15:29:34] Sam: dakota, what’s your take on last night’s events
[15:29:37] Kennedy: parker’s eagerness feels off—anyone else get that vibe
[15:29:39] Dakota: ray jumping on me this early feels like deflection—thoughts
[15:29:40] Parker: sam, what did taylor do that seemed odd to you
[15:29:41] Ray: sam, did you mean dakota—parker’s been suspiciously quiet too
[15:29:46] Kennedy: taylor, you’ve been awfully quiet—what’s your take
[15:29:47] Parker: ray’s rush to blame dakota seems suspicious—what’s his angle
[15:29:51] Dakota: parker’s eagerness feels like a distraction—what might they be hiding
[15:29:52] Sam: parker, you’ve barely chimed in—what’s your read on last night’s events
[15:29:55] Parker: taylor, since you’ve been quiet, what’s your read on the rest of us
[15:29:57] Ray: parker’s taylor comment makes no sense—who’s taylor supposed to be
[15:29:57] Dakota: sam, what exactly did you notice last night that made you suspicious
[15:29:59] Sam: taylor, you’ve been quiet—who do you suspect more, parker or ray
[15:30:03] Dakota: hold on, who’s taylor supposed to be—we don’t have a taylor here
[15:30:03] Ray: sam’s constant probing feels like a smokescreen
[15:30:10] Sam: i heard shuffling outside parker’s room around 2 am but they’ve given no explanation for it
[15:30:11] Kennedy: sam, you keep bringing up odd behavior—what exactly did you notice happening last night
[15:30:14] Ray: sam’s the only one dragging in this phantom taylor—what are they hiding
[15:30:20] Kennedy: parker, care to explain the shuffling sam heard outside your door around 2 am
[15:30:21] Dakota: sam, you mean me—ray’s aggressive tone seems more suspicious than parker’s
[15:30:22] Sam: there was no taylor last night—who’s planting false leads to distract us
[15:30:24] Parker: i slept the whole night—sam, what’s with your phantom taylor and those shuffling claims
[15:30:27] Ray: sam, were they footsteps or furniture noises
[15:30:30] Kennedy: parker, why was there shuffling outside your room at 2 am
[15:30:33] Parker: sam, how can you be sure those 2 am noises were outside my door and not someone else’s
[15:30:37] Ray: sam, you’re the only one inventing a taylor—what are you hiding
[15:30:39] Sam: did anyone else hear anything outside parker’s room around 2 am besides sam
[15:30:40] Dakota: sam, your shuffling story lacks details—what exactly did you hear at 2 am
[15:30:41] Kennedy: sam, can anyone else confirm hearing those noises at 2 am
[15:30:46] Parker: sam, unless someone else heard that noise, your shuffling story is a distraction
[15:30:48] Dakota: i didn’t hear any shuffling around 2 am—sam’s claim feels fabricated
[15:30:51] Sam: can anyone else vouch for parker’s whereabouts at 2am
[15:30:53] Kennedy: sam, was it rustling fabric or clear footsteps you heard around parker’s door at 2 am
[15:30:56] Ray: sam, what’s your real motive for inventing these shuffling noises

[15:29:16] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[15:29:20] Dakota: alright folks, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[15:29:20] Sam: did anyone notice anything odd last night
[15:29:22] Kennedy: alright everyone, let’s dig in and find our mafia
[15:29:22] Parker: hello everyone, excited to get started—any initial gut feelings on who might be mafia
[15:29:24] Ray: dakota’s been awfully quiet—maybe we should start there
[15:29:26] Sam: taylor’s been awfully quiet so far—what’s everyone thinking
[15:29:28] Dakota: time’s ticking—who do we suspect
[15:29:29] Kennedy: i didn’t notice anything odd, but whoever’s quick to point fingers might be deflecting
[15:29:29] Parker: nothing stood out to me either—sam, what did you notice
[15:29:30] Ray: kennedy’s enthusiasm feels a bit too convenient, does anyone else find that odd
[15:29:34] Sam: dakota, what’s your take on last night’s events
[15:29:37] Kennedy: parker’s eagerness feels off—anyone else get that vibe
[15:29:39] Dakota: ray jumping on me this early feels like deflection—thoughts
[15:29:40] Parker: sam, what did taylor do that seemed odd to you
[15:29:41] Ray: sam, did you mean dakota—parker’s been suspiciously quiet too
[15:29:46] Kennedy: taylor, you’ve been awfully quiet—what’s your take
[15:29:47] Parker: ray’s rush to blame dakota seems suspicious—what’s his angle
[15:29:51] Dakota: parker’s eagerness feels like a distraction—what might they be hiding
[15:29:52] Sam: parker, you’ve barely chimed in—what’s your read on last night’s events
[15:29:55] Parker: taylor, since you’ve been quiet, what’s your read on the rest of us
[15:29:57] Ray: parker’s taylor comment makes no sense—who’s taylor supposed to be
[15:29:57] Dakota: sam, what exactly did you notice last night that made you suspicious
[15:29:59] Sam: taylor, you’ve been quiet—who do you suspect more, parker or ray
[15:30:03] Dakota: hold on, who’s taylor supposed to be—we don’t have a taylor here
[15:30:03] Ray: sam’s constant probing feels like a smokescreen
[15:30:10] Sam: i heard shuffling outside parker’s room around 2 am but they’ve given no explanation for it
[15:30:11] Kennedy: sam, you keep bringing up odd behavior—what exactly did you notice happening last night
[15:30:14] Ray: sam’s the only one dragging in this phantom taylor—what are they hiding
[15:30:20] Kennedy: parker, care to explain the shuffling sam heard outside your door around 2 am
[15:30:21] Dakota: sam, you mean me—ray’s aggressive tone seems more suspicious than parker’s
[15:30:22] Sam: there was no taylor last night—who’s planting false leads to distract us
[15:30:24] Parker: i slept the whole night—sam, what’s with your phantom taylor and those shuffling claims
[15:30:27] Ray: sam, were they footsteps or furniture noises
[15:30:30] Kennedy: parker, why was there shuffling outside your room at 2 am
[15:30:33] Parker: sam, how can you be sure those 2 am noises were outside my door and not someone else’s
[15:30:37] Ray: sam, you’re the only one inventing a taylor—what are you hiding
[15:30:39] Sam: did anyone else hear anything outside parker’s room around 2 am besides sam
[15:30:40] Dakota: sam, your shuffling story lacks details—what exactly did you hear at 2 am
[15:30:41] Kennedy: sam, can anyone else confirm hearing those noises at 2 am
[15:30:46] Parker: sam, unless someone else heard that noise, your shuffling story is a distraction
[15:30:48] Dakota: i didn’t hear any shuffling around 2 am—sam’s claim feels fabricated
[15:30:51] Sam: can anyone else vouch for parker’s whereabouts at 2am
[15:30:53] Kennedy: sam, was it rustling fabric or clear footsteps you heard around parker’s door at 2 am
[15:30:56] Ray: sam, what’s your real motive for inventing these shuffling noises
[15:30:58] Parker: can anyone else vouch for sam’s alleged noises instead of us all chasing shadows
[15:31:00] Sam: parker, does your door normally creak at night or was this noise unusual

[15:29:16] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[15:29:20] Dakota: alright folks, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[15:29:20] Sam: did anyone notice anything odd last night
[15:29:22] Kennedy: alright everyone, let’s dig in and find our mafia
[15:29:22] Parker: hello everyone, excited to get started—any initial gut feelings on who might be mafia
[15:29:24] Ray: dakota’s been awfully quiet—maybe we should start there
[15:29:26] Sam: taylor’s been awfully quiet so far—what’s everyone thinking
[15:29:28] Dakota: time’s ticking—who do we suspect
[15:29:29] Kennedy: i didn’t notice anything odd, but whoever’s quick to point fingers might be deflecting
[15:29:29] Parker: nothing stood out to me either—sam, what did you notice
[15:29:30] Ray: kennedy’s enthusiasm feels a bit too convenient, does anyone else find that odd
[15:29:34] Sam: dakota, what’s your take on last night’s events
[15:29:37] Kennedy: parker’s eagerness feels off—anyone else get that vibe
[15:29:39] Dakota: ray jumping on me this early feels like deflection—thoughts
[15:29:40] Parker: sam, what did taylor do that seemed odd to you
[15:29:41] Ray: sam, did you mean dakota—parker’s been suspiciously quiet too
[15:29:46] Kennedy: taylor, you’ve been awfully quiet—what’s your take
[15:29:47] Parker: ray’s rush to blame dakota seems suspicious—what’s his angle
[15:29:51] Dakota: parker’s eagerness feels like a distraction—what might they be hiding
[15:29:52] Sam: parker, you’ve barely chimed in—what’s your read on last night’s events
[15:29:55] Parker: taylor, since you’ve been quiet, what’s your read on the rest of us
[15:29:57] Ray: parker’s taylor comment makes no sense—who’s taylor supposed to be
[15:29:57] Dakota: sam, what exactly did you notice last night that made you suspicious
[15:29:59] Sam: taylor, you’ve been quiet—who do you suspect more, parker or ray
[15:30:03] Dakota: hold on, who’s taylor supposed to be—we don’t have a taylor here
[15:30:03] Ray: sam’s constant probing feels like a smokescreen
[15:30:10] Sam: i heard shuffling outside parker’s room around 2 am but they’ve given no explanation for it
[15:30:11] Kennedy: sam, you keep bringing up odd behavior—what exactly did you notice happening last night
[15:30:14] Ray: sam’s the only one dragging in this phantom taylor—what are they hiding
[15:30:20] Kennedy: parker, care to explain the shuffling sam heard outside your door around 2 am
[15:30:21] Dakota: sam, you mean me—ray’s aggressive tone seems more suspicious than parker’s
[15:30:22] Sam: there was no taylor last night—who’s planting false leads to distract us
[15:30:24] Parker: i slept the whole night—sam, what’s with your phantom taylor and those shuffling claims
[15:30:27] Ray: sam, were they footsteps or furniture noises
[15:30:30] Kennedy: parker, why was there shuffling outside your room at 2 am
[15:30:33] Parker: sam, how can you be sure those 2 am noises were outside my door and not someone else’s
[15:30:37] Ray: sam, you’re the only one inventing a taylor—what are you hiding
[15:30:39] Sam: did anyone else hear anything outside parker’s room around 2 am besides sam
[15:30:40] Dakota: sam, your shuffling story lacks details—what exactly did you hear at 2 am
[15:30:41] Kennedy: sam, can anyone else confirm hearing those noises at 2 am
[15:30:46] Parker: sam, unless someone else heard that noise, your shuffling story is a distraction
[15:30:48] Dakota: i didn’t hear any shuffling around 2 am—sam’s claim feels fabricated
[15:30:51] Sam: can anyone else vouch for parker’s whereabouts at 2am
[15:30:53] Kennedy: sam, was it rustling fabric or clear footsteps you heard around parker’s door at 2 am
[15:30:56] Ray: sam, what’s your real motive for inventing these shuffling noises
[15:30:58] Parker: can anyone else vouch for sam’s alleged noises instead of us all chasing shadows
[15:31:00] Sam: parker, does your door normally creak at night or was this noise unusual
[15:31:04] Kennedy: parker, did your door open directly onto the main hallway or into a separate area at 2 am
[15:31:09] Parker: ray, why are you so eager to discredit sam without any proof

[15:29:20] Dakota: alright folks, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[15:29:20] Sam: did anyone notice anything odd last night
[15:29:22] Kennedy: alright everyone, let’s dig in and find our mafia
[15:29:22] Parker: hello everyone, excited to get started—any initial gut feelings on who might be mafia
[15:29:24] Ray: dakota’s been awfully quiet—maybe we should start there
[15:29:26] Sam: taylor’s been awfully quiet so far—what’s everyone thinking
[15:29:28] Dakota: time’s ticking—who do we suspect
[15:29:29] Kennedy: i didn’t notice anything odd, but whoever’s quick to point fingers might be deflecting
[15:29:29] Parker: nothing stood out to me either—sam, what did you notice
[15:29:30] Ray: kennedy’s enthusiasm feels a bit too convenient, does anyone else find that odd
[15:29:34] Sam: dakota, what’s your take on last night’s events
[15:29:37] Kennedy: parker’s eagerness feels off—anyone else get that vibe
[15:29:39] Dakota: ray jumping on me this early feels like deflection—thoughts
[15:29:40] Parker: sam, what did taylor do that seemed odd to you
[15:29:41] Ray: sam, did you mean dakota—parker’s been suspiciously quiet too
[15:29:46] Kennedy: taylor, you’ve been awfully quiet—what’s your take
[15:29:47] Parker: ray’s rush to blame dakota seems suspicious—what’s his angle
[15:29:51] Dakota: parker’s eagerness feels like a distraction—what might they be hiding
[15:29:52] Sam: parker, you’ve barely chimed in—what’s your read on last night’s events
[15:29:55] Parker: taylor, since you’ve been quiet, what’s your read on the rest of us
[15:29:57] Ray: parker’s taylor comment makes no sense—who’s taylor supposed to be
[15:29:57] Dakota: sam, what exactly did you notice last night that made you suspicious
[15:29:59] Sam: taylor, you’ve been quiet—who do you suspect more, parker or ray
[15:30:03] Dakota: hold on, who’s taylor supposed to be—we don’t have a taylor here
[15:30:03] Ray: sam’s constant probing feels like a smokescreen
[15:30:10] Sam: i heard shuffling outside parker’s room around 2 am but they’ve given no explanation for it
[15:30:11] Kennedy: sam, you keep bringing up odd behavior—what exactly did you notice happening last night
[15:30:14] Ray: sam’s the only one dragging in this phantom taylor—what are they hiding
[15:30:20] Kennedy: parker, care to explain the shuffling sam heard outside your door around 2 am
[15:30:21] Dakota: sam, you mean me—ray’s aggressive tone seems more suspicious than parker’s
[15:30:22] Sam: there was no taylor last night—who’s planting false leads to distract us
[15:30:24] Parker: i slept the whole night—sam, what’s with your phantom taylor and those shuffling claims
[15:30:27] Ray: sam, were they footsteps or furniture noises
[15:30:30] Kennedy: parker, why was there shuffling outside your room at 2 am
[15:30:33] Parker: sam, how can you be sure those 2 am noises were outside my door and not someone else’s
[15:30:37] Ray: sam, you’re the only one inventing a taylor—what are you hiding
[15:30:39] Sam: did anyone else hear anything outside parker’s room around 2 am besides sam
[15:30:40] Dakota: sam, your shuffling story lacks details—what exactly did you hear at 2 am
[15:30:41] Kennedy: sam, can anyone else confirm hearing those noises at 2 am
[15:30:46] Parker: sam, unless someone else heard that noise, your shuffling story is a distraction
[15:30:48] Dakota: i didn’t hear any shuffling around 2 am—sam’s claim feels fabricated
[15:30:51] Sam: can anyone else vouch for parker’s whereabouts at 2am
[15:30:53] Kennedy: sam, was it rustling fabric or clear footsteps you heard around parker’s door at 2 am
[15:30:56] Ray: sam, what’s your real motive for inventing these shuffling noises
[15:30:58] Parker: can anyone else vouch for sam’s alleged noises instead of us all chasing shadows
[15:31:00] Sam: parker, does your door normally creak at night or was this noise unusual
[15:31:04] Kennedy: parker, did your door open directly onto the main hallway or into a separate area at 2 am
[15:31:09] Parker: ray, why are you so eager to discredit sam without any proof
[15:31:09] Ray: since nobody else heard it, why is sam so fixated on parker’s door noises

The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.\nYou were assigned the following role: mafia.\nThe game's chat room was open at [15:29:16].\nThe other players in the game are:\n* Parker (bystander)* Sam (bystander)* Kennedy (bystander)* Dakota (bystander)The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:\n* Parker (mafia)* Sam (bystander)* Kennedy (bystander)* Dakota (bystander)"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "The current time is [15:31:32].\nHere is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:\n[15:29:16] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.\n[15:29:20] Dakota: alright folks, any early suspicions on who might be mafia\n[15:29:20] Sam: did anyone notice anything odd last night\n[15:29:22] Kennedy: alright everyone, let’s dig in and find our mafia\n[15:29:22] Parker: hello everyone, excited to get started—any initial gut feelings on who might be mafia\n[15:29:24] Ray: dakota’s been awfully quiet—maybe we should start there\n[15:29:26] Sam: taylor’s been awfully quiet so far—what’s everyone thinking\n[15:29:28] Dakota: time’s ticking—who do we suspect\n[15:29:29] Kennedy: i didn’t notice anything odd, but whoever’s quick to point fingers might be deflecting\n[15:29:29] Parker: nothing stood out to me either—sam, what did you notice\n[15:29:30] Ray: kennedy’s enthusiasm feels a bit too convenient, does anyone else find that odd\n[15:29:34] Sam: dakota, what’s your take on last night’s events\n[15:29:37] Kennedy: parker’s eagerness feels off—anyone else get that vibe\n[15:29:39] Dakota: ray jumping on me this early feels like deflection—thoughts\n[15:29:40] Parker: sam, what did taylor do that seemed odd to you\n[15:29:41] Ray: sam, did you mean dakota—parker’s been suspiciously quiet too\n[15:29:46] Kennedy: taylor, you’ve been awfully quiet—what’s your take\n[15:29:47] Parker: ray’s rush to blame dakota seems suspicious—what’s his angle\n[15:29:51] Dakota: parker’s eagerness feels like a distraction—what might they be hiding\n[15:29:52] Sam: parker, you’ve barely chimed in—what’s your read on last night’s events\n[15:29:55] Parker: taylor, since you’ve been quiet, what’s your read on the rest of us\n[15:29:57] Ray: parker’s taylor comment makes no sense—who’s taylor supposed to be\n[15:29:57] Dakota: sam, what exactly did you notice last night that made you suspicious\n[15:29:59] Sam: taylor, you’ve been quiet—who do you suspect more, parker or ray\n[15:30:03] Dakota: hold on, who’s taylor supposed to be—we don’t have a taylor here\n[15:30:03] Ray: sam’s constant probing feels like a smokescreen\n[15:30:10] Sam: i heard shuffling outside parker’s room around 2 am but they’ve given no explanation for it\n[15:30:11] Kennedy: sam, you keep bringing up odd behavior—what exactly did you notice happening last night\n[15:30:14] Ray: sam’s the only one dragging in this phantom taylor—what are they hiding\n[15:30:20] Kennedy: parker, care to explain the shuffling sam heard outside your door around 2 am\n[15:30:21] Dakota: sam, you mean me—ray’s aggressive tone seems more suspicious than parker’s\n[15:30:22] Sam: there was no taylor last night—who’s planting false leads to distract us\n[15:30:24] Parker: i slept the whole night—sam, what’s with your phantom taylor and those shuffling claims\n[15:30:27] Ray: sam, were they footsteps or furniture noises\n[15:30:30] Kennedy: parker, why was there shuffling outside your room at 2 am\n[15:30:33] Parker: sam, how can you be sure those 2 am noises were outside my door and not someone else’s\n[15:30:37] Ray: sam, you’re the only one inventing a taylor—what are you hiding\n[15:30:39] Sam: did anyone else hear anything outside parker’s room around 2 am besides sam\n[15:30:40] Dakota: sam, your shuffling story lacks details—what exactly did you hear at 2 am\n[15:30:41] Kennedy: sam, can anyone else confirm hearing those noises at 2 am\n[15:30:46] Parker: sam, unless someone else heard that noise, your shuffling story is a distraction\n[15:30:48] Dakota: i didn’t hear any shuffling around 2 am—sam’s claim feels fabricated\n[15:30:51] Sam: can anyone else vouch for parker’s whereabouts at 2am\n[15:30:53] Kennedy: sam, was it rustling fabric or clear footsteps you heard around parker’s door at 2 am\n[15:30:56] Ray: sam, what’s your real motive for inventing these shuffling noises\n[15:30:58] Parker: can anyone else vouch for sam’s alleged noises instead of us all chasing shadows\n[15:31:00] Sam: parker, does your door normally creak at night or was this noise unusual\n[15:31:04] Kennedy: parker, did your door open directly onto the main hallway or into a separate area at 2 am\n[15:31:09] Parker: ray, why are you so eager to discredit sam without any proof\n[15:31:09] Ray: since nobody else heard it, why is sam so fixated on parker’s door noises\n[15:31:16] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote!
