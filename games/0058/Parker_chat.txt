[15:29:22] Parker: hello everyone, excited to get started—any initial gut feelings on who might be mafia
[15:29:29] Parker: nothing stood out to me either—sam, what did you notice
[15:29:40] Parker: sam, what did taylor do that seemed odd to you
[15:29:47] Parker: ray’s rush to blame dakota seems suspicious—what’s his angle
[15:29:55] Parker: taylor, since you’ve been quiet, what’s your read on the rest of us
[15:30:24] Parker: i slept the whole night—sam, what’s with your phantom taylor and those shuffling claims
[15:30:33] Parker: sam, how can you be sure those 2 am noises were outside my door and not someone else’s
[15:30:46] Parker: sam, unless someone else heard that noise, your shuffling story is a distraction
[15:30:58] Parker: can anyone else vouch for sam’s alleged noises instead of us all chasing shadows
[15:31:09] Parker: ray, why are you so eager to discredit sam without any proof
[15:31:37] Parker: i vote sam for pushing a baseless noise story
