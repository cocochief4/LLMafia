[15:29:20] Sam: did anyone notice anything odd last night
[15:29:26] Sam: taylor’s been awfully quiet so far—what’s everyone thinking
[15:29:34] Sam: dakota, what’s your take on last night’s events
[15:29:52] Sam: parker, you’ve barely chimed in—what’s your read on last night’s events
[15:29:59] Sam: taylor, you’ve been quiet—who do you suspect more, parker or ray
[15:30:10] Sam: i heard shuffling outside parker’s room around 2 am but they’ve given no explanation for it
[15:30:22] Sam: there was no taylor last night—who’s planting false leads to distract us
[15:30:39] Sam: did anyone else hear anything outside parker’s room around 2 am besides sam
[15:30:51] Sam: can anyone else vouch for parker’s whereabouts at 2am
[15:31:00] Sam: parker, does your door normally creak at night or was this noise unusual
[15:31:36] Sam: my vote is on ray for deflecting with no real evidence
