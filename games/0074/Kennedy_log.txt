## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

I need to confirm I understand the roles and game flow:
- Each player is secretly mafia or bystander.
- Day phase: all discuss and vote one player to eliminate.
- Night phase: only mafia choose a bystander to eliminate.
- Mafia win by reaching parity or outnumbering bystanders.
- Bystanders win by eliminating all mafia.
I’ll respond by affirming my understanding and readiness.

Absolutely—I’ve got it! We’ve got hidden roles, a daytime discussion and vote, then a nighttime mafia kill. The mafia need to reach parity, bystanders need to lynch the mafia. Ready to jump in and start sleuthing!

[18:05:06] Drew: alright everyone, who’s your top lynch candidate
[18:05:08] Kennedy: day three: who’s drawing your suspicion so far
[18:05:08] Finley: hey everyone, who should we consider first for a vote
[18:05:09] Sidney: feels quiet—does anyone have any early suspicions
[18:05:09] Adrian: can we each share any suspicions we have so far to kick things off
[18:05:11] Parker: morning everyone, any thoughts on who's acting suspicious so far
[18:05:12] Drew: any initial gut feelings on who's mafia
Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:05:00].

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user.

Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:05:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:05:00].

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:05:00].

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:05:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown

[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection
[18:05:32] Drew: let’s start by voting parker up and see how he defends himself
[18:05:34] Parker: tyler’s rush to accuse adrian feels off
[18:05:35] Adrian: tyler, why am i more suspicious than parker, who’s barely chimed in

[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds

[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation

[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection

[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:05:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:00] Sidney: tyler’s abrupt switch to accusing adrian feels like misdirection
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:05:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown
 Tyler unknown
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia

[18:05:09] Sidney: feels quiet—does anyone have any early suspicions
[18:05:09] Adrian: can we each share any suspicions we have so far to kick things off
[18:05:11] Parker: morning everyone, any thoughts on who's acting suspicious so far
[18:05:12] Drew: any initial gut feelings on who's mafia

[18:05:16] Tyler: i’m leaning toward adrian—he’s been awfully quiet
[18:05:17] Finley: parker’s awfully quiet—any thoughts on why
[18:05:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been unusually quiet so far
[18:05:19] Adrian: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been really quiet today, what do you all think
[18:05:24] Sidney: parker’s been awfully quiet—anyone else suspicious of them
[18:05:25] Kennedy: i’m leaning parker—they’ve been awfully generic and haven’t shared anything substantial
[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection
[18:05:32] Drew: let’s start by voting parker up and see how he defends himself
[18:05:34] Parker: tyler’s rush to accuse adrian feels off
[18:05:35] Adrian: tyler, why am i more suspicious than parker, who’s barely chimed in
[18:05:36] Sidney: i’m not sold on tyler either—can we dig deeper into kennedy’s concerns about parker
[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—why zero in on tyler now
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:00] Sidney: tyler’s abrupt switch to accusing adrian feels like misdirection
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander.

The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[18:05:09] Sidney: feels quiet—does anyone have any early suspicions
[18:05:09] Adrian: can we each share any suspicions we have so far to kick things off
[18:05:11] Parker: morning everyone, any thoughts on who's acting suspicious so far
[18:05:12] Drew: any initial gut feelings on who's mafia
[18:05:14] Kennedy: i’m leaning towards parker—his silence is suspicious
[18:05:16] Tyler: i’m leaning toward adrian—he’s been awfully quiet
[18:05:17] Finley: parker’s awfully quiet—any thoughts on why
[18:05:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been unusually quiet so far
[18:05:19] Adrian: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been really quiet today, what do you all think
[18:05:24] Sidney: parker’s been awfully quiet—anyone else suspicious of them
[18:05:25] Kennedy: i’m leaning parker—they’ve been awfully generic and haven’t shared anything substantial
[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection
[18:05:32] Drew: let’s start by voting parker up and see how he defends himself
[18:05:34] Parker: tyler’s rush to accuse adrian feels off
[18:05:35] Adrian: tyler, why am i more suspicious than parker, who’s barely chimed in
[18:05:36] Sidney: i’m not sold on tyler either—can we dig deeper into kennedy’s concerns about parker
[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—why zero in on tyler now
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:00] Sidney: tyler’s abrupt switch to accusing adrian feels like misdirection
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:05:00].
The other players in the game are:

[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:00] Sidney: tyler’s abrupt switch to accusing adrian feels like misdirection
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote

The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—why zero in on tyler now
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:00] Sidney: tyler’s abrupt switch to accusing adrian feels like misdirection
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:05:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown
 Tyler unknown
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown

In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence

[18:05:17] Finley: parker’s awfully quiet—any thoughts on why
[18:05:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been unusually quiet so far
[18:05:19] Adrian: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been really quiet today, what do you all think
[18:05:24] Sidney: parker’s been awfully quiet—anyone else suspicious of them
[18:05:25] Kennedy: i’m leaning parker—they’ve been awfully generic and haven’t shared anything substantial
[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection
[18:05:32] Drew: let’s start by voting parker up and see how he defends himself
[18:05:34] Parker: tyler’s rush to accuse adrian feels off
[18:05:35] Adrian: tyler, why am i more suspicious than parker, who’s barely chimed in
[18:05:36] Sidney: i’m not sold on tyler either—can we dig deeper into kennedy’s concerns about parker
[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—why zero in on tyler now
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:00] Sidney: tyler’s abrupt switch to accusing adrian feels like misdirection
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:08:00] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[18:08:10] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Tyler

[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:08:00] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:13:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown

The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him

[18:05:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—why zero in on tyler now

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:13:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown
 Tyler (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:05:06] Drew: alright everyone, who’s your top lynch candidate
[18:05:12] Drew: any initial gut feelings on who's mafia
[18:05:32] Drew: let’s start by voting parker up and see how he defends himself
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:05:08] Finley: hey everyone, who should we consider first for a vote
[18:05:17] Finley: parker’s awfully quiet—any thoughts on why
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:05:16] Tyler: i’m leaning toward adrian—he’s been awfully quiet
[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:08] Kennedy: day three: who’s drawing your suspicion so far
[18:05:14] Kennedy: i’m leaning towards parker—his silence is suspicious
[18:05:25] Kennedy: i’m leaning parker—they’ve been awfully generic and haven’t shared anything substantial
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:13:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown
 Tyler (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown

<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection
[18:05:32] Drew: let’s start by voting parker up and see how he defends himself
[18:05:34] Parker: tyler’s rush to accuse adrian feels off
[18:05:35] Adrian: tyler, why am i more suspicious than parker, who’s barely chimed in
[18:05:36] Sidney: i’m not sold on tyler either—can we dig deeper into kennedy’s concerns about parker
[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—why zero in on tyler now
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:00] Sidney: tyler’s abrupt switch to accusing adrian feels like misdirection
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion

[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence

[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:05:11] Parker: morning everyone, any thoughts on who's acting suspicious so far
[18:05:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been unusually quiet so far
[18:05:34] Parker: tyler’s rush to accuse adrian feels off
[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:05:06] Drew: alright everyone, who’s your top lynch candidate
[18:05:12] Drew: any initial gut feelings on who's mafia
[18:05:32] Drew: let’s start by voting parker up and see how he defends himself
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:05:08] Finley: hey everyone, who should we consider first for a vote
[18:05:17] Finley: parker’s awfully quiet—any thoughts on why
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:05:16] Tyler: i’m leaning toward adrian—he’s been awfully quiet
[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:08] Kennedy: day three: who’s drawing your suspicion so far
[18:05:14] Kennedy: i’m leaning towards parker—his silence is suspicious
[18:05:25] Kennedy: i’m leaning parker—they’ve been awfully generic and haven’t shared anything substantial
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:13:18] Kennedy: locking in my vote on adrian for offering no independent reads
[18:13:18] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because his abrupt flip-flops have no credible backing
[18:13:20] Sidney: adrian, drew, and kennedy—please cast your votes now
[18:13:22] Finley: voting tyler—no quote, no defense

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:13:06].
The other players in the game are:

[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection

[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—why zero in on tyler now

[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:00] Sidney: tyler’s abrupt switch to accusing adrian feels like misdirection
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence

[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads

[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:13:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown
 Tyler (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user.

[18:08:23] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Adrian
[18:08:27] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Adrian
[18:08:39] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Tyler
[18:05:09] Adrian: can we each share any suspicions we have so far to kick things off
[18:05:19] Adrian: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been really quiet today, what do you all think
[18:05:35] Adrian: tyler, why am i more suspicious than parker, who’s barely chimed in
[18:05:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—why zero in on tyler now
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:05:09] Sidney: feels quiet—does anyone have any early suspicions
[18:05:24] Sidney: parker’s been awfully quiet—anyone else suspicious of them
[18:05:36] Sidney: i’m not sold on tyler either—can we dig deeper into kennedy’s concerns about parker
[18:06:00] Sidney: tyler’s abrupt switch to accusing adrian feels like misdirection
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:05:11] Parker: morning everyone, any thoughts on who's acting suspicious so far
[18:05:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been unusually quiet so far
[18:05:34] Parker: tyler’s rush to accuse adrian feels off
[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:05:06] Drew: alright everyone, who’s your top lynch candidate
[18:05:12] Drew: any initial gut feelings on who's mafia
[18:05:32] Drew: let’s start by voting parker up and see how he defends himself
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:05:08] Finley: hey everyone, who should we consider first for a vote
[18:05:17] Finley: parker’s awfully quiet—any thoughts on why
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:05:16] Tyler: i’m leaning toward adrian—he’s been awfully quiet
[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:08] Kennedy: day three: who’s drawing your suspicion so far
[18:05:14] Kennedy: i’m leaning towards parker—his silence is suspicious
[18:05:25] Kennedy: i’m leaning parker—they’ve been awfully generic and haven’t shared anything substantial
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:13:18] Kennedy: locking in my vote on adrian for offering no independent reads
[18:13:18] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because his abrupt flip-flops have no credible backing
[18:13:20] Sidney: adrian, drew, and kennedy—please cast your votes now
[18:13:22] Finley: voting tyler—no quote, no defense
[18:13:30] Drew: let’s cut through the noise and share one fresh, concrete reason for suspecting someone
[18:13:34] Parker: two different votes locked with zero discussion—can we each share a fresh concrete read before locking in
[18:13:37] Sidney: let’s hear from parker before we cast any more votes since they’ve been strangely silent today

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:13:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown

The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

[18:05:34] Parker: tyler’s rush to accuse adrian feels off
[18:05:35] Adrian: tyler, why am i more suspicious than parker, who’s barely chimed in

[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—why zero in on tyler now
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:00] Sidney: tyler’s abrupt switch to accusing adrian feels like misdirection
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him

[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice

[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing

[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him

[18:05:35] Adrian: tyler, why am i more suspicious than parker, who’s barely chimed in
[18:05:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—why zero in on tyler now
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:05:09] Sidney: feels quiet—does anyone have any early suspicions
[18:05:24] Sidney: parker’s been awfully quiet—anyone else suspicious of them
[18:05:36] Sidney: i’m not sold on tyler either—can we dig deeper into kennedy’s concerns about parker
[18:06:00] Sidney: tyler’s abrupt switch to accusing adrian feels like misdirection

[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker

[18:05:11] Parker: morning everyone, any thoughts on who's acting suspicious so far
[18:05:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been unusually quiet so far
[18:05:34] Parker: tyler’s rush to accuse adrian feels off
[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:05:06] Drew: alright everyone, who’s your top lynch candidate
[18:05:12] Drew: any initial gut feelings on who's mafia
[18:05:32] Drew: let’s start by voting parker up and see how he defends himself
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:05:08] Finley: hey everyone, who should we consider first for a vote
[18:05:17] Finley: parker’s awfully quiet—any thoughts on why
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:05:16] Tyler: i’m leaning toward adrian—he’s been awfully quiet
[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight

[18:05:08] Kennedy: day three: who’s drawing your suspicion so far
[18:05:14] Kennedy: i’m leaning towards parker—his silence is suspicious
[18:05:25] Kennedy: i’m leaning parker—they’ve been awfully generic and haven’t shared anything substantial
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:13:18] Kennedy: locking in my vote on adrian for offering no independent reads
[18:13:18] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because his abrupt flip-flops have no credible backing
[18:13:20] Sidney: adrian, drew, and kennedy—please cast your votes now
[18:13:22] Finley: voting tyler—no quote, no defense
[18:13:30] Drew: let’s cut through the noise and share one fresh, concrete reason for suspecting someone
[18:13:34] Parker: two different votes locked with zero discussion—can we each share a fresh concrete read before locking in
[18:13:37] Sidney: let’s hear from parker before we cast any more votes since they’ve been strangely silent today
[18:13:40] Kennedy: can we all share our current vote and one concise reason before we lock in
[18:13:41] Adrian: locking in tyler—he’s offered zero justification for his rapid accusations
[18:13:41] Drew: voting adrian—still no independent reasoning to back up his accusations
[18:13:52] Finley: i’ll stick with tyler—he’s dodged multiple requests to actually cite any evidence for his sudden flips
[18:13:53] Sidney: adrian, drew, kennedy—let’s each share one fresh concrete read now

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:13:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown
 Tyler (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:05:16] Tyler: i’m leaning toward adrian—he’s been awfully quiet
[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:08] Kennedy: day three: who’s drawing your suspicion so far
[18:05:14] Kennedy: i’m leaning towards parker—his silence is suspicious
[18:05:25] Kennedy: i’m leaning parker—they’ve been awfully generic and haven’t shared anything substantial
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:13:18] Kennedy: locking in my vote on adrian for offering no independent reads
[18:13:18] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because his abrupt flip-flops have no credible backing
[18:13:20] Sidney: adrian, drew, and kennedy—please cast your votes now
[18:13:22] Finley: voting tyler—no quote, no defense
[18:13:30] Drew: let’s cut through the noise and share one fresh, concrete reason for suspecting someone
[18:13:34] Parker: two different votes locked with zero discussion—can we each share a fresh concrete read before locking in
[18:13:37] Sidney: let’s hear from parker before we cast any more votes since they’ve been strangely silent today
[18:13:40] Kennedy: can we all share our current vote and one concise reason before we lock in
[18:13:41] Adrian: locking in tyler—he’s offered zero justification for his rapid accusations
[18:13:41] Drew: voting adrian—still no independent reasoning to back up his accusations
[18:13:52] Finley: i’ll stick with tyler—he’s dodged multiple requests to actually cite any evidence for his sudden flips
[18:13:53] Sidney: adrian, drew, kennedy—let’s each share one fresh concrete read now

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:13:06].
The other players in the game are:

[18:05:36] Sidney: i’m not sold on tyler either—can we dig deeper into kennedy’s concerns about parker
[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—why zero in on tyler now
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:00] Sidney: tyler’s abrupt switch to accusing adrian feels like misdirection
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence

[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:05:11] Parker: morning everyone, any thoughts on who's acting suspicious so far
[18:05:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been unusually quiet so far
[18:05:34] Parker: tyler’s rush to accuse adrian feels off
[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:05:06] Drew: alright everyone, who’s your top lynch candidate
[18:05:12] Drew: any initial gut feelings on who's mafia
[18:05:32] Drew: let’s start by voting parker up and see how he defends himself
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:05:08] Finley: hey everyone, who should we consider first for a vote
[18:05:17] Finley: parker’s awfully quiet—any thoughts on why
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:05:16] Tyler: i’m leaning toward adrian—he’s been awfully quiet
[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:08] Kennedy: day three: who’s drawing your suspicion so far
[18:05:14] Kennedy: i’m leaning towards parker—his silence is suspicious
[18:05:25] Kennedy: i’m leaning parker—they’ve been awfully generic and haven’t shared anything substantial
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:13:18] Kennedy: locking in my vote on adrian for offering no independent reads
[18:13:18] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because his abrupt flip-flops have no credible backing
[18:13:20] Sidney: adrian, drew, and kennedy—please cast your votes now
[18:13:22] Finley: voting tyler—no quote, no defense
[18:13:30] Drew: let’s cut through the noise and share one fresh, concrete reason for suspecting someone
[18:13:34] Parker: two different votes locked with zero discussion—can we each share a fresh concrete read before locking in
[18:13:37] Sidney: let’s hear from parker before we cast any more votes since they’ve been strangely silent today
[18:13:40] Kennedy: can we all share our current vote and one concise reason before we lock in
[18:13:41] Adrian: locking in tyler—he’s offered zero justification for his rapid accusations
[18:13:41] Drew: voting adrian—still no independent reasoning to back up his accusations
[18:13:52] Finley: i’ll stick with tyler—he’s dodged multiple requests to actually cite any evidence for his sudden flips
[18:13:53] Sidney: adrian, drew, kennedy—let’s each share one fresh concrete read now
[18:13:53] Kennedy: parker, please share your fresh concrete read so we can finalize our votes
[18:13:55] Adrian: adrian: voting tyler—his constant flip-flops lack any substantive proof
[18:13:57] Drew: voting parker—he’s offered zero fresh observations despite prompts for specifics

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:13:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown
 Tyler (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[18:13:34] Parker: two different votes locked with zero discussion—can we each share a fresh concrete read before locking in
[18:13:37] Sidney: let’s hear from parker before we cast any more votes since they’ve been strangely silent today
[18:13:40] Kennedy: can we all share our current vote and one concise reason before we lock in
[18:13:41] Adrian: locking in tyler—he’s offered zero justification for his rapid accusations
[18:13:41] Drew: voting adrian—still no independent reasoning to back up his accusations
[18:13:52] Finley: i’ll stick with tyler—he’s dodged multiple requests to actually cite any evidence for his sudden flips
[18:13:53] Sidney: adrian, drew, kennedy—let’s each share one fresh concrete read now
[18:13:53] Kennedy: parker, please share your fresh concrete read so we can finalize our votes
[18:13:55] Adrian: adrian: voting tyler—his constant flip-flops lack any substantive proof
[18:13:57] Drew: voting parker—he’s offered zero fresh observations despite prompts for specifics

[18:05:24] Sidney: parker’s been awfully quiet—anyone else suspicious of them
[18:05:25] Kennedy: i’m leaning parker—they’ve been awfully generic and haven’t shared anything substantial
[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection
[18:05:32] Drew: let’s start by voting parker up and see how he defends himself
[18:05:34] Parker: tyler’s rush to accuse adrian feels off
[18:05:35] Adrian: tyler, why am i more suspicious than parker, who’s barely chimed in
[18:05:36] Sidney: i’m not sold on tyler either—can we dig deeper into kennedy’s concerns about parker
[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—why zero in on tyler now
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:00] Sidney: tyler’s abrupt switch to accusing adrian feels like misdirection
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:13:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown

[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him

[18:05:36] Sidney: i’m not sold on tyler either—can we dig deeper into kennedy’s concerns about parker

[18:05:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been unusually quiet so far
[18:05:34] Parker: tyler’s rush to accuse adrian feels off
[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence

[18:05:32] Drew: let’s start by voting parker up and see how he defends himself
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd

[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection

[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence

[18:05:14] Kennedy: i’m leaning towards parker—his silence is suspicious
[18:05:25] Kennedy: i’m leaning parker—they’ve been awfully generic and haven’t shared anything substantial
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch

[18:13:22] Finley: voting tyler—no quote, no defense
[18:13:30] Drew: let’s cut through the noise and share one fresh, concrete reason for suspecting someone
[18:13:34] Parker: two different votes locked with zero discussion—can we each share a fresh concrete read before locking in
[18:13:37] Sidney: let’s hear from parker before we cast any more votes since they’ve been strangely silent today
[18:13:40] Kennedy: can we all share our current vote and one concise reason before we lock in
[18:13:41] Adrian: locking in tyler—he’s offered zero justification for his rapid accusations
[18:13:41] Drew: voting adrian—still no independent reasoning to back up his accusations
[18:13:52] Finley: i’ll stick with tyler—he’s dodged multiple requests to actually cite any evidence for his sudden flips
[18:13:53] Sidney: adrian, drew, kennedy—let’s each share one fresh concrete read now
[18:13:53] Kennedy: parker, please share your fresh concrete read so we can finalize our votes
[18:13:55] Adrian: adrian: voting tyler—his constant flip-flops lack any substantive proof
[18:13:57] Drew: voting parker—he’s offered zero fresh observations despite prompts for specifics

[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:05:08] Finley: hey everyone, who should we consider first for a vote
[18:05:17] Finley: parker’s awfully quiet—any thoughts on why
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:05:16] Tyler: i’m leaning toward adrian—he’s been awfully quiet
[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:08] Kennedy: day three: who’s drawing your suspicion so far
[18:05:14] Kennedy: i’m leaning towards parker—his silence is suspicious
[18:05:25] Kennedy: i’m leaning parker—they’ve been awfully generic and haven’t shared anything substantial
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:13:18] Kennedy: locking in my vote on adrian for offering no independent reads
[18:13:18] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because his abrupt flip-flops have no credible backing
[18:13:20] Sidney: adrian, drew, and kennedy—please cast your votes now
[18:13:22] Finley: voting tyler—no quote, no defense
[18:13:30] Drew: let’s cut through the noise and share one fresh, concrete reason for suspecting someone
[18:13:34] Parker: two different votes locked with zero discussion—can we each share a fresh concrete read before locking in
[18:13:37] Sidney: let’s hear from parker before we cast any more votes since they’ve been strangely silent today
[18:13:40] Kennedy: can we all share our current vote and one concise reason before we lock in
[18:13:41] Adrian: locking in tyler—he’s offered zero justification for his rapid accusations
[18:13:41] Drew: voting adrian—still no independent reasoning to back up his accusations
[18:13:52] Finley: i’ll stick with tyler—he’s dodged multiple requests to actually cite any evidence for his sudden flips
[18:13:53] Sidney: adrian, drew, kennedy—let’s each share one fresh concrete read now
[18:13:53] Kennedy: parker, please share your fresh concrete read so we can finalize our votes
[18:13:55] Adrian: adrian: voting tyler—his constant flip-flops lack any substantive proof
[18:13:57] Drew: voting parker—he’s offered zero fresh observations despite prompts for specifics
[18:14:04] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian—he’s just mirrored tyler’s points instead of offering his own analysis
[18:14:08] Parker: i’m voting adrian; he’s only repeated tyler’s deflections instead of offering any independent reasoning

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:13:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown
 Tyler (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection

[18:05:34] Parker: tyler’s rush to accuse adrian feels off
[18:05:35] Adrian: tyler, why am i more suspicious than parker, who’s barely chimed in

[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—why zero in on tyler now
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:00] Sidney: tyler’s abrupt switch to accusing adrian feels like misdirection
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him

[18:13:22] Finley: voting tyler—no quote, no defense
[18:13:30] Drew: let’s cut through the noise and share one fresh, concrete reason for suspecting someone
[18:13:34] Parker: two different votes locked with zero discussion—can we each share a fresh concrete read before locking in
[18:13:37] Sidney: let’s hear from parker before we cast any more votes since they’ve been strangely silent today
[18:13:40] Kennedy: can we all share our current vote and one concise reason before we lock in
[18:13:41] Adrian: locking in tyler—he’s offered zero justification for his rapid accusations
[18:13:41] Drew: voting adrian—still no independent reasoning to back up his accusations
[18:13:52] Finley: i’ll stick with tyler—he’s dodged multiple requests to actually cite any evidence for his sudden flips
[18:13:53] Sidney: adrian, drew, kennedy—let’s each share one fresh concrete read now
[18:13:53] Kennedy: parker, please share your fresh concrete read so we can finalize our votes
[18:13:55] Adrian: adrian: voting tyler—his constant flip-flops lack any substantive proof
[18:13:57] Drew: voting parker—he’s offered zero fresh observations despite prompts for specifics
[18:14:04] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian—he’s just mirrored tyler’s points instead of offering his own analysis
[18:14:08] Parker: i’m voting adrian; he’s only repeated tyler’s deflections instead of offering any independent reasoning
[18:14:08] Adrian: my fresh read: parker’s procedural stalling feels like a mafia slowdown tactic
[18:14:09] Finley: voting tyler—he’s failed to back up his shift with any evidence
[18:14:13] Drew: locking in adrian—parker, share your fresh concrete read now
[18:14:22] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m voting sidney because she’s yet to provide any specifics for her suspicions

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:13:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown
 Tyler (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown

<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him

[18:05:35] Adrian: tyler, why am i more suspicious than parker, who’s barely chimed in
[18:05:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—why zero in on tyler now
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them

[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia

[18:05:24] Sidney: parker’s been awfully quiet—anyone else suspicious of them
[18:05:36] Sidney: i’m not sold on tyler either—can we dig deeper into kennedy’s concerns about parker
[18:06:00] Sidney: tyler’s abrupt switch to accusing adrian feels like misdirection

[18:05:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been unusually quiet so far
[18:05:34] Parker: tyler’s rush to accuse adrian feels off
[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection

[18:05:12] Drew: any initial gut feelings on who's mafia
[18:05:32] Drew: let’s start by voting parker up and see how he defends himself
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler

[18:05:08] Finley: hey everyone, who should we consider first for a vote
[18:05:17] Finley: parker’s awfully quiet—any thoughts on why
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler

[18:05:16] Tyler: i’m leaning toward adrian—he’s been awfully quiet
[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:08] Kennedy: day three: who’s drawing your suspicion so far
[18:05:14] Kennedy: i’m leaning towards parker—his silence is suspicious
[18:05:25] Kennedy: i’m leaning parker—they’ve been awfully generic and haven’t shared anything substantial
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:13:18] Kennedy: locking in my vote on adrian for offering no independent reads
[18:13:18] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because his abrupt flip-flops have no credible backing
[18:13:20] Sidney: adrian, drew, and kennedy—please cast your votes now
[18:13:22] Finley: voting tyler—no quote, no defense
[18:13:30] Drew: let’s cut through the noise and share one fresh, concrete reason for suspecting someone
[18:13:34] Parker: two different votes locked with zero discussion—can we each share a fresh concrete read before locking in
[18:13:37] Sidney: let’s hear from parker before we cast any more votes since they’ve been strangely silent today
[18:13:40] Kennedy: can we all share our current vote and one concise reason before we lock in
[18:13:41] Adrian: locking in tyler—he’s offered zero justification for his rapid accusations
[18:13:41] Drew: voting adrian—still no independent reasoning to back up his accusations
[18:13:52] Finley: i’ll stick with tyler—he’s dodged multiple requests to actually cite any evidence for his sudden flips
[18:13:53] Sidney: adrian, drew, kennedy—let’s each share one fresh concrete read now
[18:13:53] Kennedy: parker, please share your fresh concrete read so we can finalize our votes
[18:13:55] Adrian: adrian: voting tyler—his constant flip-flops lack any substantive proof
[18:13:57] Drew: voting parker—he’s offered zero fresh observations despite prompts for specifics
[18:14:04] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian—he’s just mirrored tyler’s points instead of offering his own analysis
[18:14:08] Parker: i’m voting adrian; he’s only repeated tyler’s deflections instead of offering any independent reasoning
[18:14:08] Adrian: my fresh read: parker’s procedural stalling feels like a mafia slowdown tactic
[18:14:09] Finley: voting tyler—he’s failed to back up his shift with any evidence
[18:14:13] Drew: locking in adrian—parker, share your fresh concrete read now
[18:14:22] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m voting sidney because she’s yet to provide any specifics for her suspicions

[18:05:32] Drew: let’s start by voting parker up and see how he defends himself
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:05:08] Finley: hey everyone, who should we consider first for a vote
[18:05:17] Finley: parker’s awfully quiet—any thoughts on why
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:05:16] Tyler: i’m leaning toward adrian—he’s been awfully quiet
[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:08] Kennedy: day three: who’s drawing your suspicion so far
[18:05:14] Kennedy: i’m leaning towards parker—his silence is suspicious
[18:05:25] Kennedy: i’m leaning parker—they’ve been awfully generic and haven’t shared anything substantial
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:13:18] Kennedy: locking in my vote on adrian for offering no independent reads
[18:13:18] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because his abrupt flip-flops have no credible backing
[18:13:20] Sidney: adrian, drew, and kennedy—please cast your votes now
[18:13:22] Finley: voting tyler—no quote, no defense
[18:13:30] Drew: let’s cut through the noise and share one fresh, concrete reason for suspecting someone
[18:13:34] Parker: two different votes locked with zero discussion—can we each share a fresh concrete read before locking in
[18:13:37] Sidney: let’s hear from parker before we cast any more votes since they’ve been strangely silent today
[18:13:40] Kennedy: can we all share our current vote and one concise reason before we lock in
[18:13:41] Adrian: locking in tyler—he’s offered zero justification for his rapid accusations
[18:13:41] Drew: voting adrian—still no independent reasoning to back up his accusations
[18:13:52] Finley: i’ll stick with tyler—he’s dodged multiple requests to actually cite any evidence for his sudden flips
[18:13:53] Sidney: adrian, drew, kennedy—let’s each share one fresh concrete read now
[18:13:53] Kennedy: parker, please share your fresh concrete read so we can finalize our votes
[18:13:55] Adrian: adrian: voting tyler—his constant flip-flops lack any substantive proof
[18:13:57] Drew: voting parker—he’s offered zero fresh observations despite prompts for specifics
[18:14:04] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian—he’s just mirrored tyler’s points instead of offering his own analysis
[18:14:08] Parker: i’m voting adrian; he’s only repeated tyler’s deflections instead of offering any independent reasoning
[18:14:08] Adrian: my fresh read: parker’s procedural stalling feels like a mafia slowdown tactic
[18:14:09] Finley: voting tyler—he’s failed to back up his shift with any evidence
[18:14:13] Drew: locking in adrian—parker, share your fresh concrete read now
[18:14:22] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m voting sidney because she’s yet to provide any specifics for her suspicions
[18:14:27] Parker: drew’s vote for adrian with no fresh reasoning looks like a flip-flop
[18:14:30] Adrian: sidney, can you share your final vote so we can wrap this up

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:13:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown
 Tyler (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[18:05:24] Sidney: parker’s been awfully quiet—anyone else suspicious of them
[18:05:25] Kennedy: i’m leaning parker—they’ve been awfully generic and haven’t shared anything substantial
[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection
[18:05:32] Drew: let’s start by voting parker up and see how he defends himself
[18:05:34] Parker: tyler’s rush to accuse adrian feels off
[18:05:35] Adrian: tyler, why am i more suspicious than parker, who’s barely chimed in
[18:05:36] Sidney: i’m not sold on tyler either—can we dig deeper into kennedy’s concerns about parker
[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—why zero in on tyler now
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:00] Sidney: tyler’s abrupt switch to accusing adrian feels like misdirection
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:13:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown
 Tyler (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>.

[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence

[18:05:35] Adrian: tyler, why am i more suspicious than parker, who’s barely chimed in
[18:05:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—why zero in on tyler now

[18:05:36] Sidney: i’m not sold on tyler either—can we dig deeper into kennedy’s concerns about parker

[18:05:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been unusually quiet so far
[18:05:34] Parker: tyler’s rush to accuse adrian feels off
[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions

[18:05:06] Drew: alright everyone, who’s your top lynch candidate
[18:05:12] Drew: any initial gut feelings on who's mafia
[18:05:32] Drew: let’s start by voting parker up and see how he defends himself
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler

[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged

[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence

[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:08] Kennedy: day three: who’s drawing your suspicion so far
[18:05:14] Kennedy: i’m leaning towards parker—his silence is suspicious
[18:05:25] Kennedy: i’m leaning parker—they’ve been awfully generic and haven’t shared anything substantial
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:13:18] Kennedy: locking in my vote on adrian for offering no independent reads
[18:13:18] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because his abrupt flip-flops have no credible backing
[18:13:20] Sidney: adrian, drew, and kennedy—please cast your votes now
[18:13:22] Finley: voting tyler—no quote, no defense
[18:13:30] Drew: let’s cut through the noise and share one fresh, concrete reason for suspecting someone
[18:13:34] Parker: two different votes locked with zero discussion—can we each share a fresh concrete read before locking in
[18:13:37] Sidney: let’s hear from parker before we cast any more votes since they’ve been strangely silent today
[18:13:40] Kennedy: can we all share our current vote and one concise reason before we lock in
[18:13:41] Adrian: locking in tyler—he’s offered zero justification for his rapid accusations
[18:13:41] Drew: voting adrian—still no independent reasoning to back up his accusations
[18:13:52] Finley: i’ll stick with tyler—he’s dodged multiple requests to actually cite any evidence for his sudden flips
[18:13:53] Sidney: adrian, drew, kennedy—let’s each share one fresh concrete read now
[18:13:53] Kennedy: parker, please share your fresh concrete read so we can finalize our votes
[18:13:55] Adrian: adrian: voting tyler—his constant flip-flops lack any substantive proof
[18:13:57] Drew: voting parker—he’s offered zero fresh observations despite prompts for specifics
[18:14:04] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian—he’s just mirrored tyler’s points instead of offering his own analysis
[18:14:08] Parker: i’m voting adrian; he’s only repeated tyler’s deflections instead of offering any independent reasoning
[18:14:08] Adrian: my fresh read: parker’s procedural stalling feels like a mafia slowdown tactic
[18:14:09] Finley: voting tyler—he’s failed to back up his shift with any evidence
[18:14:13] Drew: locking in adrian—parker, share your fresh concrete read now
[18:14:22] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m voting sidney because she’s yet to provide any specifics for her suspicions
[18:14:27] Parker: drew’s vote for adrian with no fresh reasoning looks like a flip-flop
[18:14:30] Adrian: sidney, can you share your final vote so we can wrap this up
[18:14:36] Sidney: voting tyler—still no credible defense from him
[18:14:36] Drew: we’re deadlocked—who has a fresh concrete read to break the tie

[18:05:36] Sidney: i’m not sold on tyler either—can we dig deeper into kennedy’s concerns about parker
[18:06:00] Sidney: tyler’s abrupt switch to accusing adrian feels like misdirection
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:05:11] Parker: morning everyone, any thoughts on who's acting suspicious so far
[18:05:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been unusually quiet so far
[18:05:34] Parker: tyler’s rush to accuse adrian feels off
[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:05:06] Drew: alright everyone, who’s your top lynch candidate
[18:05:12] Drew: any initial gut feelings on who's mafia
[18:05:32] Drew: let’s start by voting parker up and see how he defends himself
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:05:08] Finley: hey everyone, who should we consider first for a vote
[18:05:17] Finley: parker’s awfully quiet—any thoughts on why
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:05:16] Tyler: i’m leaning toward adrian—he’s been awfully quiet
[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:08] Kennedy: day three: who’s drawing your suspicion so far
[18:05:14] Kennedy: i’m leaning towards parker—his silence is suspicious
[18:05:25] Kennedy: i’m leaning parker—they’ve been awfully generic and haven’t shared anything substantial
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:13:18] Kennedy: locking in my vote on adrian for offering no independent reads
[18:13:18] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because his abrupt flip-flops have no credible backing
[18:13:20] Sidney: adrian, drew, and kennedy—please cast your votes now
[18:13:22] Finley: voting tyler—no quote, no defense
[18:13:30] Drew: let’s cut through the noise and share one fresh, concrete reason for suspecting someone
[18:13:34] Parker: two different votes locked with zero discussion—can we each share a fresh concrete read before locking in
[18:13:37] Sidney: let’s hear from parker before we cast any more votes since they’ve been strangely silent today
[18:13:40] Kennedy: can we all share our current vote and one concise reason before we lock in
[18:13:41] Adrian: locking in tyler—he’s offered zero justification for his rapid accusations
[18:13:41] Drew: voting adrian—still no independent reasoning to back up his accusations
[18:13:52] Finley: i’ll stick with tyler—he’s dodged multiple requests to actually cite any evidence for his sudden flips
[18:13:53] Sidney: adrian, drew, kennedy—let’s each share one fresh concrete read now
[18:13:53] Kennedy: parker, please share your fresh concrete read so we can finalize our votes
[18:13:55] Adrian: adrian: voting tyler—his constant flip-flops lack any substantive proof
[18:13:57] Drew: voting parker—he’s offered zero fresh observations despite prompts for specifics
[18:14:04] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian—he’s just mirrored tyler’s points instead of offering his own analysis
[18:14:08] Parker: i’m voting adrian; he’s only repeated tyler’s deflections instead of offering any independent reasoning
[18:14:08] Adrian: my fresh read: parker’s procedural stalling feels like a mafia slowdown tactic
[18:14:09] Finley: voting tyler—he’s failed to back up his shift with any evidence
[18:14:13] Drew: locking in adrian—parker, share your fresh concrete read now
[18:14:22] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m voting sidney because she’s yet to provide any specifics for her suspicions
[18:14:27] Parker: drew’s vote for adrian with no fresh reasoning looks like a flip-flop
[18:14:30] Adrian: sidney, can you share your final vote so we can wrap this up
[18:14:36] Sidney: voting tyler—still no credible defense from him
[18:14:36] Drew: we’re deadlocked—who has a fresh concrete read to break the tie
[18:14:38] Finley: parker’s stall just now felt more like deliberate delay than genuine analysis

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:13:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown
 Tyler (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>.

[18:05:25] Kennedy: i’m leaning parker—they’ve been awfully generic and haven’t shared anything substantial
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:13:18] Kennedy: locking in my vote on adrian for offering no independent reads
[18:13:18] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because his abrupt flip-flops have no credible backing
[18:13:20] Sidney: adrian, drew, and kennedy—please cast your votes now
[18:13:22] Finley: voting tyler—no quote, no defense
[18:13:30] Drew: let’s cut through the noise and share one fresh, concrete reason for suspecting someone
[18:13:34] Parker: two different votes locked with zero discussion—can we each share a fresh concrete read before locking in
[18:13:37] Sidney: let’s hear from parker before we cast any more votes since they’ve been strangely silent today
[18:13:40] Kennedy: can we all share our current vote and one concise reason before we lock in
[18:13:41] Adrian: locking in tyler—he’s offered zero justification for his rapid accusations
[18:13:41] Drew: voting adrian—still no independent reasoning to back up his accusations
[18:13:52] Finley: i’ll stick with tyler—he’s dodged multiple requests to actually cite any evidence for his sudden flips
[18:13:53] Sidney: adrian, drew, kennedy—let’s each share one fresh concrete read now
[18:13:53] Kennedy: parker, please share your fresh concrete read so we can finalize our votes
[18:13:55] Adrian: adrian: voting tyler—his constant flip-flops lack any substantive proof
[18:13:57] Drew: voting parker—he’s offered zero fresh observations despite prompts for specifics
[18:14:04] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian—he’s just mirrored tyler’s points instead of offering his own analysis
[18:14:08] Parker: i’m voting adrian; he’s only repeated tyler’s deflections instead of offering any independent reasoning
[18:14:08] Adrian: my fresh read: parker’s procedural stalling feels like a mafia slowdown tactic
[18:14:09] Finley: voting tyler—he’s failed to back up his shift with any evidence
[18:14:13] Drew: locking in adrian—parker, share your fresh concrete read now
[18:14:22] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m voting sidney because she’s yet to provide any specifics for her suspicions
[18:14:27] Parker: drew’s vote for adrian with no fresh reasoning looks like a flip-flop
[18:14:30] Adrian: sidney, can you share your final vote so we can wrap this up
[18:14:36] Sidney: voting tyler—still no credible defense from him
[18:14:36] Drew: we’re deadlocked—who has a fresh concrete read to break the tie
[18:14:38] Finley: parker’s stall just now felt more like deliberate delay than genuine analysis

[18:05:00] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[18:05:06] Drew: alright everyone, who’s your top lynch candidate
[18:05:08] Kennedy: day three: who’s drawing your suspicion so far
[18:05:08] Finley: hey everyone, who should we consider first for a vote
[18:05:09] Sidney: feels quiet—does anyone have any early suspicions
[18:05:09] Adrian: can we each share any suspicions we have so far to kick things off
[18:05:11] Parker: morning everyone, any thoughts on who's acting suspicious so far
[18:05:12] Drew: any initial gut feelings on who's mafia
[18:05:14] Kennedy: i’m leaning towards parker—his silence is suspicious
[18:05:16] Tyler: i’m leaning toward adrian—he’s been awfully quiet
[18:05:17] Finley: parker’s awfully quiet—any thoughts on why
[18:05:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been unusually quiet so far
[18:05:19] Adrian: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been really quiet today, what do you all think
[18:05:24] Sidney: parker’s been awfully quiet—anyone else suspicious of them
[18:05:25] Kennedy: i’m leaning parker—they’ve been awfully generic and haven’t shared anything substantial
[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection
[18:05:32] Drew: let’s start by voting parker up and see how he defends himself
[18:05:34] Parker: tyler’s rush to accuse adrian feels off
[18:05:35] Adrian: tyler, why am i more suspicious than parker, who’s barely chimed in
[18:05:36] Sidney: i’m not sold on tyler either—can we dig deeper into kennedy’s concerns about parker
[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—why zero in on tyler now
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:00] Sidney: tyler’s abrupt switch to accusing adrian feels like misdirection
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:08:00] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

[18:08:12] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Tyler

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:13:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown
 Tyler (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown

<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection
[18:05:32] Drew: let’s start by voting parker up and see how he defends himself
[18:05:34] Parker: tyler’s rush to accuse adrian feels off
[18:05:35] Adrian: tyler, why am i more suspicious than parker, who’s barely chimed in
[18:05:36] Sidney: i’m not sold on tyler either—can we dig deeper into kennedy’s concerns about parker

[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—why zero in on tyler now
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:00] Sidney: tyler’s abrupt switch to accusing adrian feels like misdirection
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him

[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:13:18] Kennedy: locking in my vote on adrian for offering no independent reads
[18:13:18] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because his abrupt flip-flops have no credible backing
[18:13:20] Sidney: adrian, drew, and kennedy—please cast your votes now
[18:13:22] Finley: voting tyler—no quote, no defense
[18:13:30] Drew: let’s cut through the noise and share one fresh, concrete reason for suspecting someone
[18:13:34] Parker: two different votes locked with zero discussion—can we each share a fresh concrete read before locking in
[18:13:37] Sidney: let’s hear from parker before we cast any more votes since they’ve been strangely silent today
[18:13:40] Kennedy: can we all share our current vote and one concise reason before we lock in
[18:13:41] Adrian: locking in tyler—he’s offered zero justification for his rapid accusations
[18:13:41] Drew: voting adrian—still no independent reasoning to back up his accusations
[18:13:52] Finley: i’ll stick with tyler—he’s dodged multiple requests to actually cite any evidence for his sudden flips
[18:13:53] Sidney: adrian, drew, kennedy—let’s each share one fresh concrete read now
[18:13:53] Kennedy: parker, please share your fresh concrete read so we can finalize our votes
[18:13:55] Adrian: adrian: voting tyler—his constant flip-flops lack any substantive proof
[18:13:57] Drew: voting parker—he’s offered zero fresh observations despite prompts for specifics
[18:14:04] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian—he’s just mirrored tyler’s points instead of offering his own analysis
[18:14:08] Parker: i’m voting adrian; he’s only repeated tyler’s deflections instead of offering any independent reasoning
[18:14:08] Adrian: my fresh read: parker’s procedural stalling feels like a mafia slowdown tactic
[18:14:09] Finley: voting tyler—he’s failed to back up his shift with any evidence
[18:14:13] Drew: locking in adrian—parker, share your fresh concrete read now
[18:14:22] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m voting sidney because she’s yet to provide any specifics for her suspicions
[18:14:27] Parker: drew’s vote for adrian with no fresh reasoning looks like a flip-flop
[18:14:30] Adrian: sidney, can you share your final vote so we can wrap this up
[18:14:36] Sidney: voting tyler—still no credible defense from him
[18:14:36] Drew: we’re deadlocked—who has a fresh concrete read to break the tie
[18:14:38] Finley: parker’s stall just now felt more like deliberate delay than genuine analysis
[18:14:53] Adrian: adrian: sidney, you’ve pushed votes on multiple players with hardly any fresh reads—what concrete evidence are you basing your choice on
[18:14:55] Sidney: voting tyler—he still hasn’t backed up any of those sudden shifts with specifics
[18:14:55] Parker: sidney, can you share one concrete reason for your vote so we have a clearer picture

[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:08:00] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[18:08:10] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Tyler

[18:05:09] Adrian: can we each share any suspicions we have so far to kick things off
[18:05:19] Adrian: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been really quiet today, what do you all think
[18:05:35] Adrian: tyler, why am i more suspicious than parker, who’s barely chimed in
[18:05:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—why zero in on tyler now
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:05:09] Sidney: feels quiet—does anyone have any early suspicions
[18:05:24] Sidney: parker’s been awfully quiet—anyone else suspicious of them
[18:05:36] Sidney: i’m not sold on tyler either—can we dig deeper into kennedy’s concerns about parker
[18:06:00] Sidney: tyler’s abrupt switch to accusing adrian feels like misdirection
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:05:11] Parker: morning everyone, any thoughts on who's acting suspicious so far
[18:05:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been unusually quiet so far
[18:05:34] Parker: tyler’s rush to accuse adrian feels off
[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:05:06] Drew: alright everyone, who’s your top lynch candidate
[18:05:12] Drew: any initial gut feelings on who's mafia
[18:05:32] Drew: let’s start by voting parker up and see how he defends himself
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:05:08] Finley: hey everyone, who should we consider first for a vote
[18:05:17] Finley: parker’s awfully quiet—any thoughts on why
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:05:16] Tyler: i’m leaning toward adrian—he’s been awfully quiet
[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:08] Kennedy: day three: who’s drawing your suspicion so far
[18:05:14] Kennedy: i’m leaning towards parker—his silence is suspicious
[18:05:25] Kennedy: i’m leaning parker—they’ve been awfully generic and haven’t shared anything substantial
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:13:18] Kennedy: locking in my vote on adrian for offering no independent reads
[18:13:18] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because his abrupt flip-flops have no credible backing
[18:13:20] Sidney: adrian, drew, and kennedy—please cast your votes now
[18:13:22] Finley: voting tyler—no quote, no defense
[18:13:30] Drew: let’s cut through the noise and share one fresh, concrete reason for suspecting someone
[18:13:34] Parker: two different votes locked with zero discussion—can we each share a fresh concrete read before locking in
[18:13:37] Sidney: let’s hear from parker before we cast any more votes since they’ve been strangely silent today
[18:13:40] Kennedy: can we all share our current vote and one concise reason before we lock in
[18:13:41] Adrian: locking in tyler—he’s offered zero justification for his rapid accusations
[18:13:41] Drew: voting adrian—still no independent reasoning to back up his accusations
[18:13:52] Finley: i’ll stick with tyler—he’s dodged multiple requests to actually cite any evidence for his sudden flips
[18:13:53] Sidney: adrian, drew, kennedy—let’s each share one fresh concrete read now
[18:13:53] Kennedy: parker, please share your fresh concrete read so we can finalize our votes
[18:13:55] Adrian: adrian: voting tyler—his constant flip-flops lack any substantive proof
[18:13:57] Drew: voting parker—he’s offered zero fresh observations despite prompts for specifics
[18:14:04] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian—he’s just mirrored tyler’s points instead of offering his own analysis
[18:14:08] Parker: i’m voting adrian; he’s only repeated tyler’s deflections instead of offering any independent reasoning
[18:14:08] Adrian: my fresh read: parker’s procedural stalling feels like a mafia slowdown tactic
[18:14:09] Finley: voting tyler—he’s failed to back up his shift with any evidence
[18:14:13] Drew: locking in adrian—parker, share your fresh concrete read now
[18:14:22] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m voting sidney because she’s yet to provide any specifics for her suspicions
[18:14:27] Parker: drew’s vote for adrian with no fresh reasoning looks like a flip-flop
[18:14:30] Adrian: sidney, can you share your final vote so we can wrap this up
[18:14:36] Sidney: voting tyler—still no credible defense from him
[18:14:36] Drew: we’re deadlocked—who has a fresh concrete read to break the tie
[18:14:38] Finley: parker’s stall just now felt more like deliberate delay than genuine analysis
[18:14:53] Adrian: adrian: sidney, you’ve pushed votes on multiple players with hardly any fresh reads—what concrete evidence are you basing your choice on
[18:14:55] Sidney: voting tyler—he still hasn’t backed up any of those sudden shifts with specifics
[18:14:55] Parker: sidney, can you share one concrete reason for your vote so we have a clearer picture
[18:14:59] Drew: tyler, please share one final concrete reason for your sudden accusation shifts before votes close

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:13:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown

The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:05:06] Drew: alright everyone, who’s your top lynch candidate
[18:05:12] Drew: any initial gut feelings on who's mafia
[18:05:32] Drew: let’s start by voting parker up and see how he defends himself
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:05:08] Finley: hey everyone, who should we consider first for a vote
[18:05:17] Finley: parker’s awfully quiet—any thoughts on why
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:05:16] Tyler: i’m leaning toward adrian—he’s been awfully quiet
[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:08] Kennedy: day three: who’s drawing your suspicion so far
[18:05:14] Kennedy: i’m leaning towards parker—his silence is suspicious
[18:05:25] Kennedy: i’m leaning parker—they’ve been awfully generic and haven’t shared anything substantial
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:13:18] Kennedy: locking in my vote on adrian for offering no independent reads
[18:13:18] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because his abrupt flip-flops have no credible backing
[18:13:20] Sidney: adrian, drew, and kennedy—please cast your votes now
[18:13:22] Finley: voting tyler—no quote, no defense
[18:13:30] Drew: let’s cut through the noise and share one fresh, concrete reason for suspecting someone
[18:13:34] Parker: two different votes locked with zero discussion—can we each share a fresh concrete read before locking in
[18:13:37] Sidney: let’s hear from parker before we cast any more votes since they’ve been strangely silent today
[18:13:40] Kennedy: can we all share our current vote and one concise reason before we lock in
[18:13:41] Adrian: locking in tyler—he’s offered zero justification for his rapid accusations
[18:13:41] Drew: voting adrian—still no independent reasoning to back up his accusations
[18:13:52] Finley: i’ll stick with tyler—he’s dodged multiple requests to actually cite any evidence for his sudden flips
[18:13:53] Sidney: adrian, drew, kennedy—let’s each share one fresh concrete read now
[18:13:53] Kennedy: parker, please share your fresh concrete read so we can finalize our votes
[18:13:55] Adrian: adrian: voting tyler—his constant flip-flops lack any substantive proof
[18:13:57] Drew: voting parker—he’s offered zero fresh observations despite prompts for specifics
[18:14:04] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian—he’s just mirrored tyler’s points instead of offering his own analysis
[18:14:08] Parker: i’m voting adrian; he’s only repeated tyler’s deflections instead of offering any independent reasoning
[18:14:08] Adrian: my fresh read: parker’s procedural stalling feels like a mafia slowdown tactic
[18:14:09] Finley: voting tyler—he’s failed to back up his shift with any evidence
[18:14:13] Drew: locking in adrian—parker, share your fresh concrete read now
[18:14:22] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m voting sidney because she’s yet to provide any specifics for her suspicions
[18:14:27] Parker: drew’s vote for adrian with no fresh reasoning looks like a flip-flop
[18:14:30] Adrian: sidney, can you share your final vote so we can wrap this up
[18:14:36] Sidney: voting tyler—still no credible defense from him
[18:14:36] Drew: we’re deadlocked—who has a fresh concrete read to break the tie
[18:14:38] Finley: parker’s stall just now felt more like deliberate delay than genuine analysis
[18:14:53] Adrian: adrian: sidney, you’ve pushed votes on multiple players with hardly any fresh reads—what concrete evidence are you basing your choice on
[18:14:55] Sidney: voting tyler—he still hasn’t backed up any of those sudden shifts with specifics
[18:14:55] Parker: sidney, can you share one concrete reason for your vote so we have a clearer picture
[18:14:59] Drew: tyler, please share one final concrete reason for your sudden accusation shifts before votes close

[18:13:53] Kennedy: parker, please share your fresh concrete read so we can finalize our votes
[18:13:55] Adrian: adrian: voting tyler—his constant flip-flops lack any substantive proof
[18:13:57] Drew: voting parker—he’s offered zero fresh observations despite prompts for specifics
[18:14:04] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian—he’s just mirrored tyler’s points instead of offering his own analysis
[18:14:08] Parker: i’m voting adrian; he’s only repeated tyler’s deflections instead of offering any independent reasoning
[18:14:08] Adrian: my fresh read: parker’s procedural stalling feels like a mafia slowdown tactic
[18:14:09] Finley: voting tyler—he’s failed to back up his shift with any evidence
[18:14:13] Drew: locking in adrian—parker, share your fresh concrete read now
[18:14:22] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m voting sidney because she’s yet to provide any specifics for her suspicions
[18:14:27] Parker: drew’s vote for adrian with no fresh reasoning looks like a flip-flop
[18:14:30] Adrian: sidney, can you share your final vote so we can wrap this up
[18:14:36] Sidney: voting tyler—still no credible defense from him
[18:14:36] Drew: we’re deadlocked—who has a fresh concrete read to break the tie
[18:14:38] Finley: parker’s stall just now felt more like deliberate delay than genuine analysis
[18:14:53] Adrian: adrian: sidney, you’ve pushed votes on multiple players with hardly any fresh reads—what concrete evidence are you basing your choice on
[18:14:55] Sidney: voting tyler—he still hasn’t backed up any of those sudden shifts with specifics
[18:14:55] Parker: sidney, can you share one concrete reason for your vote so we have a clearer picture
[18:14:59] Drew: tyler, please share one final concrete reason for your sudden accusation shifts before votes close
[18:15:12] Finley: tyler never explained why they dropped the sidney-silence suspicion to target adrian, and that abrupt switch screams deflection
[18:15:12] Sidney: i’m voting parker because she’s spent this round demanding proof but hasn’t offered a single concrete read herself
[18:15:14] Parker: i’m voting tyler—he’s been deflecting with meta critiques all day without offering any actual suspicious observations

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:13:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown
 Tyler (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[18:05:09] Sidney: feels quiet—does anyone have any early suspicions
[18:05:09] Adrian: can we each share any suspicions we have so far to kick things off
[18:05:11] Parker: morning everyone, any thoughts on who's acting suspicious so far
[18:05:12] Drew: any initial gut feelings on who's mafia
[18:05:14] Kennedy: i’m leaning towards parker—his silence is suspicious
[18:05:16] Tyler: i’m leaning toward adrian—he’s been awfully quiet
[18:05:17] Finley: parker’s awfully quiet—any thoughts on why
[18:05:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been unusually quiet so far
[18:05:19] Adrian: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been really quiet today, what do you all think
[18:05:24] Sidney: parker’s been awfully quiet—anyone else suspicious of them
[18:05:25] Kennedy: i’m leaning parker—they’ve been awfully generic and haven’t shared anything substantial
[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection
[18:05:32] Drew: let’s start by voting parker up and see how he defends himself
[18:05:34] Parker: tyler’s rush to accuse adrian feels off
[18:05:35] Adrian: tyler, why am i more suspicious than parker, who’s barely chimed in
[18:05:36] Sidney: i’m not sold on tyler either—can we dig deeper into kennedy’s concerns about parker
[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—why zero in on tyler now
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:00] Sidney: tyler’s abrupt switch to accusing adrian feels like misdirection
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:08:00] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

[18:13:22] Finley: voting tyler—no quote, no defense
[18:13:30] Drew: let’s cut through the noise and share one fresh, concrete reason for suspecting someone
[18:13:34] Parker: two different votes locked with zero discussion—can we each share a fresh concrete read before locking in
[18:13:37] Sidney: let’s hear from parker before we cast any more votes since they’ve been strangely silent today
[18:13:40] Kennedy: can we all share our current vote and one concise reason before we lock in
[18:13:41] Adrian: locking in tyler—he’s offered zero justification for his rapid accusations
[18:13:41] Drew: voting adrian—still no independent reasoning to back up his accusations
[18:13:52] Finley: i’ll stick with tyler—he’s dodged multiple requests to actually cite any evidence for his sudden flips

[18:14:04] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian—he’s just mirrored tyler’s points instead of offering his own analysis
[18:14:08] Parker: i’m voting adrian; he’s only repeated tyler’s deflections instead of offering any independent reasoning

[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection

[18:05:34] Parker: tyler’s rush to accuse adrian feels off
[18:05:35] Adrian: tyler, why am i more suspicious than parker, who’s barely chimed in
[18:05:36] Sidney: i’m not sold on tyler either—can we dig deeper into kennedy’s concerns about parker
[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—why zero in on tyler now

[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:00] Sidney: tyler’s abrupt switch to accusing adrian feels like misdirection
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him

[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:13:18] Kennedy: locking in my vote on adrian for offering no independent reads
[18:13:18] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because his abrupt flip-flops have no credible backing
[18:13:20] Sidney: adrian, drew, and kennedy—please cast your votes now
[18:13:22] Finley: voting tyler—no quote, no defense
[18:13:30] Drew: let’s cut through the noise and share one fresh, concrete reason for suspecting someone
[18:13:34] Parker: two different votes locked with zero discussion—can we each share a fresh concrete read before locking in
[18:13:37] Sidney: let’s hear from parker before we cast any more votes since they’ve been strangely silent today
[18:13:40] Kennedy: can we all share our current vote and one concise reason before we lock in
[18:13:41] Adrian: locking in tyler—he’s offered zero justification for his rapid accusations
[18:13:41] Drew: voting adrian—still no independent reasoning to back up his accusations
[18:13:52] Finley: i’ll stick with tyler—he’s dodged multiple requests to actually cite any evidence for his sudden flips
[18:13:53] Sidney: adrian, drew, kennedy—let’s each share one fresh concrete read now
[18:13:53] Kennedy: parker, please share your fresh concrete read so we can finalize our votes
[18:13:55] Adrian: adrian: voting tyler—his constant flip-flops lack any substantive proof
[18:13:57] Drew: voting parker—he’s offered zero fresh observations despite prompts for specifics
[18:14:04] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian—he’s just mirrored tyler’s points instead of offering his own analysis
[18:14:08] Parker: i’m voting adrian; he’s only repeated tyler’s deflections instead of offering any independent reasoning
[18:14:08] Adrian: my fresh read: parker’s procedural stalling feels like a mafia slowdown tactic
[18:14:09] Finley: voting tyler—he’s failed to back up his shift with any evidence
[18:14:13] Drew: locking in adrian—parker, share your fresh concrete read now
[18:14:22] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m voting sidney because she’s yet to provide any specifics for her suspicions
[18:14:27] Parker: drew’s vote for adrian with no fresh reasoning looks like a flip-flop
[18:14:30] Adrian: sidney, can you share your final vote so we can wrap this up
[18:14:36] Sidney: voting tyler—still no credible defense from him
[18:14:36] Drew: we’re deadlocked—who has a fresh concrete read to break the tie
[18:14:38] Finley: parker’s stall just now felt more like deliberate delay than genuine analysis
[18:14:53] Adrian: adrian: sidney, you’ve pushed votes on multiple players with hardly any fresh reads—what concrete evidence are you basing your choice on
[18:14:55] Sidney: voting tyler—he still hasn’t backed up any of those sudden shifts with specifics
[18:14:55] Parker: sidney, can you share one concrete reason for your vote so we have a clearer picture
[18:14:59] Drew: tyler, please share one final concrete reason for your sudden accusation shifts before votes close
[18:15:12] Finley: tyler never explained why they dropped the sidney-silence suspicion to target adrian, and that abrupt switch screams deflection
[18:15:12] Sidney: i’m voting parker because she’s spent this round demanding proof but hasn’t offered a single concrete read herself
[18:15:14] Parker: i’m voting tyler—he’s been deflecting with meta critiques all day without offering any actual suspicious observations

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:13:06].

[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him

[18:05:09] Adrian: can we each share any suspicions we have so far to kick things off
[18:05:19] Adrian: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been really quiet today, what do you all think
[18:05:35] Adrian: tyler, why am i more suspicious than parker, who’s barely chimed in
[18:05:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—why zero in on tyler now
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:05:09] Sidney: feels quiet—does anyone have any early suspicions
[18:05:24] Sidney: parker’s been awfully quiet—anyone else suspicious of them
[18:05:36] Sidney: i’m not sold on tyler either—can we dig deeper into kennedy’s concerns about parker
[18:06:00] Sidney: tyler’s abrupt switch to accusing adrian feels like misdirection
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:05:11] Parker: morning everyone, any thoughts on who's acting suspicious so far
[18:05:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been unusually quiet so far
[18:05:34] Parker: tyler’s rush to accuse adrian feels off
[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:05:06] Drew: alright everyone, who’s your top lynch candidate
[18:05:12] Drew: any initial gut feelings on who's mafia
[18:05:32] Drew: let’s start by voting parker up and see how he defends himself
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:05:08] Finley: hey everyone, who should we consider first for a vote
[18:05:17] Finley: parker’s awfully quiet—any thoughts on why
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:05:16] Tyler: i’m leaning toward adrian—he’s been awfully quiet
[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:08] Kennedy: day three: who’s drawing your suspicion so far
[18:05:14] Kennedy: i’m leaning towards parker—his silence is suspicious
[18:05:25] Kennedy: i’m leaning parker—they’ve been awfully generic and haven’t shared anything substantial
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:13:18] Kennedy: locking in my vote on adrian for offering no independent reads
[18:13:18] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because his abrupt flip-flops have no credible backing
[18:13:20] Sidney: adrian, drew, and kennedy—please cast your votes now
[18:13:22] Finley: voting tyler—no quote, no defense
[18:13:30] Drew: let’s cut through the noise and share one fresh, concrete reason for suspecting someone
[18:13:34] Parker: two different votes locked with zero discussion—can we each share a fresh concrete read before locking in
[18:13:37] Sidney: let’s hear from parker before we cast any more votes since they’ve been strangely silent today
[18:13:40] Kennedy: can we all share our current vote and one concise reason before we lock in
[18:13:41] Adrian: locking in tyler—he’s offered zero justification for his rapid accusations
[18:13:41] Drew: voting adrian—still no independent reasoning to back up his accusations
[18:13:52] Finley: i’ll stick with tyler—he’s dodged multiple requests to actually cite any evidence for his sudden flips
[18:13:53] Sidney: adrian, drew, kennedy—let’s each share one fresh concrete read now
[18:13:53] Kennedy: parker, please share your fresh concrete read so we can finalize our votes
[18:13:55] Adrian: adrian: voting tyler—his constant flip-flops lack any substantive proof
[18:13:57] Drew: voting parker—he’s offered zero fresh observations despite prompts for specifics
[18:14:04] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian—he’s just mirrored tyler’s points instead of offering his own analysis
[18:14:08] Parker: i’m voting adrian; he’s only repeated tyler’s deflections instead of offering any independent reasoning
[18:14:08] Adrian: my fresh read: parker’s procedural stalling feels like a mafia slowdown tactic
[18:14:09] Finley: voting tyler—he’s failed to back up his shift with any evidence
[18:14:13] Drew: locking in adrian—parker, share your fresh concrete read now
[18:14:22] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m voting sidney because she’s yet to provide any specifics for her suspicions
[18:14:27] Parker: drew’s vote for adrian with no fresh reasoning looks like a flip-flop
[18:14:30] Adrian: sidney, can you share your final vote so we can wrap this up
[18:14:36] Sidney: voting tyler—still no credible defense from him
[18:14:36] Drew: we’re deadlocked—who has a fresh concrete read to break the tie
[18:14:38] Finley: parker’s stall just now felt more like deliberate delay than genuine analysis
[18:14:53] Adrian: adrian: sidney, you’ve pushed votes on multiple players with hardly any fresh reads—what concrete evidence are you basing your choice on
[18:14:55] Sidney: voting tyler—he still hasn’t backed up any of those sudden shifts with specifics
[18:14:55] Parker: sidney, can you share one concrete reason for your vote so we have a clearer picture
[18:14:59] Drew: tyler, please share one final concrete reason for your sudden accusation shifts before votes close
[18:15:12] Finley: tyler never explained why they dropped the sidney-silence suspicion to target adrian, and that abrupt switch screams deflection
[18:15:12] Sidney: i’m voting parker because she’s spent this round demanding proof but hasn’t offered a single concrete read herself
[18:15:14] Parker: i’m voting tyler—he’s been deflecting with meta critiques all day without offering any actual suspicious observations

[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:05:08] Finley: hey everyone, who should we consider first for a vote
[18:05:17] Finley: parker’s awfully quiet—any thoughts on why
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:05:16] Tyler: i’m leaning toward adrian—he’s been awfully quiet
[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:08] Kennedy: day three: who’s drawing your suspicion so far
[18:05:14] Kennedy: i’m leaning towards parker—his silence is suspicious
[18:05:25] Kennedy: i’m leaning parker—they’ve been awfully generic and haven’t shared anything substantial
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:13:18] Kennedy: locking in my vote on adrian for offering no independent reads
[18:13:18] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because his abrupt flip-flops have no credible backing
[18:13:20] Sidney: adrian, drew, and kennedy—please cast your votes now
[18:13:22] Finley: voting tyler—no quote, no defense
[18:13:30] Drew: let’s cut through the noise and share one fresh, concrete reason for suspecting someone
[18:13:34] Parker: two different votes locked with zero discussion—can we each share a fresh concrete read before locking in
[18:13:37] Sidney: let’s hear from parker before we cast any more votes since they’ve been strangely silent today
[18:13:40] Kennedy: can we all share our current vote and one concise reason before we lock in
[18:13:41] Adrian: locking in tyler—he’s offered zero justification for his rapid accusations
[18:13:41] Drew: voting adrian—still no independent reasoning to back up his accusations
[18:13:52] Finley: i’ll stick with tyler—he’s dodged multiple requests to actually cite any evidence for his sudden flips
[18:13:53] Sidney: adrian, drew, kennedy—let’s each share one fresh concrete read now
[18:13:53] Kennedy: parker, please share your fresh concrete read so we can finalize our votes
[18:13:55] Adrian: adrian: voting tyler—his constant flip-flops lack any substantive proof
[18:13:57] Drew: voting parker—he’s offered zero fresh observations despite prompts for specifics
[18:14:04] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian—he’s just mirrored tyler’s points instead of offering his own analysis
[18:14:08] Parker: i’m voting adrian; he’s only repeated tyler’s deflections instead of offering any independent reasoning
[18:14:08] Adrian: my fresh read: parker’s procedural stalling feels like a mafia slowdown tactic
[18:14:09] Finley: voting tyler—he’s failed to back up his shift with any evidence
[18:14:13] Drew: locking in adrian—parker, share your fresh concrete read now
[18:14:22] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m voting sidney because she’s yet to provide any specifics for her suspicions
[18:14:27] Parker: drew’s vote for adrian with no fresh reasoning looks like a flip-flop
[18:14:30] Adrian: sidney, can you share your final vote so we can wrap this up
[18:14:36] Sidney: voting tyler—still no credible defense from him
[18:14:36] Drew: we’re deadlocked—who has a fresh concrete read to break the tie
[18:14:38] Finley: parker’s stall just now felt more like deliberate delay than genuine analysis
[18:14:53] Adrian: adrian: sidney, you’ve pushed votes on multiple players with hardly any fresh reads—what concrete evidence are you basing your choice on
[18:14:55] Sidney: voting tyler—he still hasn’t backed up any of those sudden shifts with specifics
[18:14:55] Parker: sidney, can you share one concrete reason for your vote so we have a clearer picture
[18:14:59] Drew: tyler, please share one final concrete reason for your sudden accusation shifts before votes close
[18:15:12] Finley: tyler never explained why they dropped the sidney-silence suspicion to target adrian, and that abrupt switch screams deflection
[18:15:12] Sidney: i’m voting parker because she’s spent this round demanding proof but hasn’t offered a single concrete read herself
[18:15:14] Parker: i’m voting tyler—he’s been deflecting with meta critiques all day without offering any actual suspicious observations
[18:15:18] Adrian: parker, you’re the tiebreaker—who are you locking in and why
[18:15:19] Drew: sidney, share one specific example behind your vote or i’ll move mine to parker
[18:15:25] Sidney: i’m voting tyler because he’s repeatedly switched targets under pressure yet never cites any actual evidence
[18:15:35] Finley: tyler’s unexplained switch between targets without ever quoting any evidence is a glaring mafia tell
[18:15:43] Parker: kennedy, can you provide one fresh concrete read to break this tie

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:13:06].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown

The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:13:18] Kennedy: locking in my vote on adrian for offering no independent reads
[18:13:18] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because his abrupt flip-flops have no credible backing
[18:13:20] Sidney: adrian, drew, and kennedy—please cast your votes now
[18:13:22] Finley: voting tyler—no quote, no defense
[18:13:30] Drew: let’s cut through the noise and share one fresh, concrete reason for suspecting someone
[18:13:34] Parker: two different votes locked with zero discussion—can we each share a fresh concrete read before locking in
[18:13:37] Sidney: let’s hear from parker before we cast any more votes since they’ve been strangely silent today
[18:13:40] Kennedy: can we all share our current vote and one concise reason before we lock in
[18:13:41] Adrian: locking in tyler—he’s offered zero justification for his rapid accusations
[18:13:41] Drew: voting adrian—still no independent reasoning to back up his accusations
[18:13:52] Finley: i’ll stick with tyler—he’s dodged multiple requests to actually cite any evidence for his sudden flips
[18:13:53] Sidney: adrian, drew, kennedy—let’s each share one fresh concrete read now
[18:13:53] Kennedy: parker, please share your fresh concrete read so we can finalize our votes
[18:13:55] Adrian: adrian: voting tyler—his constant flip-flops lack any substantive proof
[18:13:57] Drew: voting parker—he’s offered zero fresh observations despite prompts for specifics
[18:14:04] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian—he’s just mirrored tyler’s points instead of offering his own analysis
[18:14:08] Parker: i’m voting adrian; he’s only repeated tyler’s deflections instead of offering any independent reasoning
[18:14:08] Adrian: my fresh read: parker’s procedural stalling feels like a mafia slowdown tactic
[18:14:09] Finley: voting tyler—he’s failed to back up his shift with any evidence
[18:14:13] Drew: locking in adrian—parker, share your fresh concrete read now
[18:14:22] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m voting sidney because she’s yet to provide any specifics for her suspicions
[18:14:27] Parker: drew’s vote for adrian with no fresh reasoning looks like a flip-flop
[18:14:30] Adrian: sidney, can you share your final vote so we can wrap this up
[18:14:36] Sidney: voting tyler—still no credible defense from him
[18:14:36] Drew: we’re deadlocked—who has a fresh concrete read to break the tie
[18:14:38] Finley: parker’s stall just now felt more like deliberate delay than genuine analysis
[18:14:53] Adrian: adrian: sidney, you’ve pushed votes on multiple players with hardly any fresh reads—what concrete evidence are you basing your choice on
[18:14:55] Sidney: voting tyler—he still hasn’t backed up any of those sudden shifts with specifics
[18:14:55] Parker: sidney, can you share one concrete reason for your vote so we have a clearer picture
[18:14:59] Drew: tyler, please share one final concrete reason for your sudden accusation shifts before votes close
[18:15:12] Finley: tyler never explained why they dropped the sidney-silence suspicion to target adrian, and that abrupt switch screams deflection
[18:15:12] Sidney: i’m voting parker because she’s spent this round demanding proof but hasn’t offered a single concrete read herself
[18:15:14] Parker: i’m voting tyler—he’s been deflecting with meta critiques all day without offering any actual suspicious observations
[18:15:18] Adrian: parker, you’re the tiebreaker—who are you locking in and why
[18:15:19] Drew: sidney, share one specific example behind your vote or i’ll move mine to parker
[18:15:25] Sidney: i’m voting tyler because he’s repeatedly switched targets under pressure yet never cites any actual evidence
[18:15:35] Finley: tyler’s unexplained switch between targets without ever quoting any evidence is a glaring mafia tell
[18:15:43] Parker: kennedy, can you provide one fresh concrete read to break this tie

[18:05:00] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[18:05:06] Drew: alright everyone, who’s your top lynch candidate
[18:05:08] Kennedy: day three: who’s drawing your suspicion so far
[18:05:08] Finley: hey everyone, who should we consider first for a vote
[18:05:09] Sidney: feels quiet—does anyone have any early suspicions
[18:05:09] Adrian: can we each share any suspicions we have so far to kick things off
[18:05:11] Parker: morning everyone, any thoughts on who's acting suspicious so far
[18:05:12] Drew: any initial gut feelings on who's mafia
[18:05:14] Kennedy: i’m leaning towards parker—his silence is suspicious
[18:05:16] Tyler: i’m leaning toward adrian—he’s been awfully quiet
[18:05:17] Finley: parker’s awfully quiet—any thoughts on why
[18:05:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been unusually quiet so far
[18:05:19] Adrian: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been really quiet today, what do you all think
[18:05:24] Sidney: parker’s been awfully quiet—anyone else suspicious of them
[18:05:25] Kennedy: i’m leaning parker—they’ve been awfully generic and haven’t shared anything substantial
[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection
[18:05:32] Drew: let’s start by voting parker up and see how he defends himself
[18:05:34] Parker: tyler’s rush to accuse adrian feels off
[18:05:35] Adrian: tyler, why am i more suspicious than parker, who’s barely chimed in
[18:05:36] Sidney: i’m not sold on tyler either—can we dig deeper into kennedy’s concerns about parker
[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—why zero in on tyler now
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:00] Sidney: tyler’s abrupt switch to accusing adrian feels like misdirection
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:08:00] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[18:08:10] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Tyler
[18:08:12] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Tyler

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:13:06].

[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch

[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation

[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection

[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection

[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him

[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:13:18] Kennedy: locking in my vote on adrian for offering no independent reads
[18:13:18] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because his abrupt flip-flops have no credible backing
[18:13:20] Sidney: adrian, drew, and kennedy—please cast your votes now
[18:13:22] Finley: voting tyler—no quote, no defense
[18:13:30] Drew: let’s cut through the noise and share one fresh, concrete reason for suspecting someone
[18:13:34] Parker: two different votes locked with zero discussion—can we each share a fresh concrete read before locking in
[18:13:37] Sidney: let’s hear from parker before we cast any more votes since they’ve been strangely silent today
[18:13:40] Kennedy: can we all share our current vote and one concise reason before we lock in
[18:13:41] Adrian: locking in tyler—he’s offered zero justification for his rapid accusations
[18:13:41] Drew: voting adrian—still no independent reasoning to back up his accusations
[18:13:52] Finley: i’ll stick with tyler—he’s dodged multiple requests to actually cite any evidence for his sudden flips
[18:13:53] Sidney: adrian, drew, kennedy—let’s each share one fresh concrete read now
[18:13:53] Kennedy: parker, please share your fresh concrete read so we can finalize our votes
[18:13:55] Adrian: adrian: voting tyler—his constant flip-flops lack any substantive proof
[18:13:57] Drew: voting parker—he’s offered zero fresh observations despite prompts for specifics
[18:14:04] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian—he’s just mirrored tyler’s points instead of offering his own analysis
[18:14:08] Parker: i’m voting adrian; he’s only repeated tyler’s deflections instead of offering any independent reasoning
[18:14:08] Adrian: my fresh read: parker’s procedural stalling feels like a mafia slowdown tactic
[18:14:09] Finley: voting tyler—he’s failed to back up his shift with any evidence
[18:14:13] Drew: locking in adrian—parker, share your fresh concrete read now
[18:14:22] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m voting sidney because she’s yet to provide any specifics for her suspicions
[18:14:27] Parker: drew’s vote for adrian with no fresh reasoning looks like a flip-flop
[18:14:30] Adrian: sidney, can you share your final vote so we can wrap this up
[18:14:36] Sidney: voting tyler—still no credible defense from him
[18:14:36] Drew: we’re deadlocked—who has a fresh concrete read to break the tie
[18:14:38] Finley: parker’s stall just now felt more like deliberate delay than genuine analysis
[18:14:53] Adrian: adrian: sidney, you’ve pushed votes on multiple players with hardly any fresh reads—what concrete evidence are you basing your choice on
[18:14:55] Sidney: voting tyler—he still hasn’t backed up any of those sudden shifts with specifics
[18:14:55] Parker: sidney, can you share one concrete reason for your vote so we have a clearer picture
[18:14:59] Drew: tyler, please share one final concrete reason for your sudden accusation shifts before votes close
[18:15:12] Finley: tyler never explained why they dropped the sidney-silence suspicion to target adrian, and that abrupt switch screams deflection
[18:15:12] Sidney: i’m voting parker because she’s spent this round demanding proof but hasn’t offered a single concrete read herself
[18:15:14] Parker: i’m voting tyler—he’s been deflecting with meta critiques all day without offering any actual suspicious observations
[18:15:18] Adrian: parker, you’re the tiebreaker—who are you locking in and why
[18:15:19] Drew: sidney, share one specific example behind your vote or i’ll move mine to parker
[18:15:25] Sidney: i’m voting tyler because he’s repeatedly switched targets under pressure yet never cites any actual evidence
[18:15:35] Finley: tyler’s unexplained switch between targets without ever quoting any evidence is a glaring mafia tell
[18:15:43] Parker: kennedy, can you provide one fresh concrete read to break this tie

[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:08:00] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

[18:05:09] Adrian: can we each share any suspicions we have so far to kick things off
[18:05:19] Adrian: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been really quiet today, what do you all think
[18:05:35] Adrian: tyler, why am i more suspicious than parker, who’s barely chimed in
[18:05:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—why zero in on tyler now
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:05:09] Sidney: feels quiet—does anyone have any early suspicions
[18:05:24] Sidney: parker’s been awfully quiet—anyone else suspicious of them
[18:05:36] Sidney: i’m not sold on tyler either—can we dig deeper into kennedy’s concerns about parker
[18:06:00] Sidney: tyler’s abrupt switch to accusing adrian feels like misdirection
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker

[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:05:11] Parker: morning everyone, any thoughts on who's acting suspicious so far
[18:05:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been unusually quiet so far
[18:05:34] Parker: tyler’s rush to accuse adrian feels off
[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:05:06] Drew: alright everyone, who’s your top lynch candidate
[18:05:12] Drew: any initial gut feelings on who's mafia
[18:05:32] Drew: let’s start by voting parker up and see how he defends himself
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:05:08] Finley: hey everyone, who should we consider first for a vote
[18:05:17] Finley: parker’s awfully quiet—any thoughts on why
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:05:16] Tyler: i’m leaning toward adrian—he’s been awfully quiet
[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:08] Kennedy: day three: who’s drawing your suspicion so far
[18:05:14] Kennedy: i’m leaning towards parker—his silence is suspicious
[18:05:25] Kennedy: i’m leaning parker—they’ve been awfully generic and haven’t shared anything substantial
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:13:18] Kennedy: locking in my vote on adrian for offering no independent reads
[18:13:18] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because his abrupt flip-flops have no credible backing
[18:13:20] Sidney: adrian, drew, and kennedy—please cast your votes now
[18:13:22] Finley: voting tyler—no quote, no defense
[18:13:30] Drew: let’s cut through the noise and share one fresh, concrete reason for suspecting someone
[18:13:34] Parker: two different votes locked with zero discussion—can we each share a fresh concrete read before locking in
[18:13:37] Sidney: let’s hear from parker before we cast any more votes since they’ve been strangely silent today
[18:13:40] Kennedy: can we all share our current vote and one concise reason before we lock in
[18:13:41] Adrian: locking in tyler—he’s offered zero justification for his rapid accusations
[18:13:41] Drew: voting adrian—still no independent reasoning to back up his accusations
[18:13:52] Finley: i’ll stick with tyler—he’s dodged multiple requests to actually cite any evidence for his sudden flips
[18:13:53] Sidney: adrian, drew, kennedy—let’s each share one fresh concrete read now
[18:13:53] Kennedy: parker, please share your fresh concrete read so we can finalize our votes
[18:13:55] Adrian: adrian: voting tyler—his constant flip-flops lack any substantive proof
[18:13:57] Drew: voting parker—he’s offered zero fresh observations despite prompts for specifics
[18:14:04] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian—he’s just mirrored tyler’s points instead of offering his own analysis
[18:14:08] Parker: i’m voting adrian; he’s only repeated tyler’s deflections instead of offering any independent reasoning
[18:14:08] Adrian: my fresh read: parker’s procedural stalling feels like a mafia slowdown tactic
[18:14:09] Finley: voting tyler—he’s failed to back up his shift with any evidence
[18:14:13] Drew: locking in adrian—parker, share your fresh concrete read now
[18:14:22] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m voting sidney because she’s yet to provide any specifics for her suspicions
[18:14:27] Parker: drew’s vote for adrian with no fresh reasoning looks like a flip-flop
[18:14:30] Adrian: sidney, can you share your final vote so we can wrap this up
[18:14:36] Sidney: voting tyler—still no credible defense from him
[18:14:36] Drew: we’re deadlocked—who has a fresh concrete read to break the tie
[18:14:38] Finley: parker’s stall just now felt more like deliberate delay than genuine analysis
[18:14:53] Adrian: adrian: sidney, you’ve pushed votes on multiple players with hardly any fresh reads—what concrete evidence are you basing your choice on
[18:14:55] Sidney: voting tyler—he still hasn’t backed up any of those sudden shifts with specifics
[18:14:55] Parker: sidney, can you share one concrete reason for your vote so we have a clearer picture
[18:14:59] Drew: tyler, please share one final concrete reason for your sudden accusation shifts before votes close
[18:15:12] Finley: tyler never explained why they dropped the sidney-silence suspicion to target adrian, and that abrupt switch screams deflection
[18:15:12] Sidney: i’m voting parker because she’s spent this round demanding proof but hasn’t offered a single concrete read herself
[18:15:14] Parker: i’m voting tyler—he’s been deflecting with meta critiques all day without offering any actual suspicious observations
[18:15:18] Adrian: parker, you’re the tiebreaker—who are you locking in and why
[18:15:19] Drew: sidney, share one specific example behind your vote or i’ll move mine to parker
[18:15:25] Sidney: i’m voting tyler because he’s repeatedly switched targets under pressure yet never cites any actual evidence
[18:15:35] Finley: tyler’s unexplained switch between targets without ever quoting any evidence is a glaring mafia tell
[18:15:43] Parker: kennedy, can you provide one fresh concrete read to break this tie
[18:15:43] Kennedy: sidney, share one specific reason for voting tyler so we can finalize
[18:15:49] Drew: locking in tyler—his flip-flops keep coming without any supporting detail
[18:15:54] Sidney: parker ignored multiple prompts for her own concrete read and instead deflected back onto others
[18:16:00] Parker: tyler’s baseless deflections leave me no choice but to lock in tyler
[18:16:06] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:08:00] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[18:08:10] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Tyler
[18:08:12] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Tyler
[18:13:06] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[18:08:19] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Tyler
[18:08:19] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[18:08:23] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Adrian
[18:08:27] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Adrian
[18:08:39] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Tyler
[18:05:09] Adrian: can we each share any suspicions we have so far to kick things off
[18:05:19] Adrian: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been really quiet today, what do you all think
[18:05:35] Adrian: tyler, why am i more suspicious than parker, who’s barely chimed in
[18:05:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—why zero in on tyler now
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:05:09] Sidney: feels quiet—does anyone have any early suspicions
[18:05:24] Sidney: parker’s been awfully quiet—anyone else suspicious of them
[18:05:36] Sidney: i’m not sold on tyler either—can we dig deeper into kennedy’s concerns about parker
[18:06:00] Sidney: tyler’s abrupt switch to accusing adrian feels like misdirection
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:05:11] Parker: morning everyone, any thoughts on who's acting suspicious so far
[18:05:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been unusually quiet so far
[18:05:34] Parker: tyler’s rush to accuse adrian feels off
[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:05:06] Drew: alright everyone, who’s your top lynch candidate
[18:05:12] Drew: any initial gut feelings on who's mafia
[18:05:32] Drew: let’s start by voting parker up and see how he defends himself
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:05:08] Finley: hey everyone, who should we consider first for a vote
[18:05:17] Finley: parker’s awfully quiet—any thoughts on why
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:05:16] Tyler: i’m leaning toward adrian—he’s been awfully quiet
[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:08] Kennedy: day three: who’s drawing your suspicion so far
[18:05:14] Kennedy: i’m leaning towards parker—his silence is suspicious
[18:05:25] Kennedy: i’m leaning parker—they’ve been awfully generic and haven’t shared anything substantial
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:13:18] Kennedy: locking in my vote on adrian for offering no independent reads
[18:13:18] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because his abrupt flip-flops have no credible backing
[18:13:20] Sidney: adrian, drew, and kennedy—please cast your votes now
[18:13:22] Finley: voting tyler—no quote, no defense
[18:13:30] Drew: let’s cut through the noise and share one fresh, concrete reason for suspecting someone
[18:13:34] Parker: two different votes locked with zero discussion—can we each share a fresh concrete read before locking in
[18:13:37] Sidney: let’s hear from parker before we cast any more votes since they’ve been strangely silent today
[18:13:40] Kennedy: can we all share our current vote and one concise reason before we lock in
[18:13:41] Adrian: locking in tyler—he’s offered zero justification for his rapid accusations
[18:13:41] Drew: voting adrian—still no independent reasoning to back up his accusations
[18:13:52] Finley: i’ll stick with tyler—he’s dodged multiple requests to actually cite any evidence for his sudden flips
[18:13:53] Sidney: adrian, drew, kennedy—let’s each share one fresh concrete read now
[18:13:53] Kennedy: parker, please share your fresh concrete read so we can finalize our votes
[18:13:55] Adrian: adrian: voting tyler—his constant flip-flops lack any substantive proof
[18:13:57] Drew: voting parker—he’s offered zero fresh observations despite prompts for specifics
[18:14:04] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian—he’s just mirrored tyler’s points instead of offering his own analysis
[18:14:08] Parker: i’m voting adrian; he’s only repeated tyler’s deflections instead of offering any independent reasoning
[18:14:08] Adrian: my fresh read: parker’s procedural stalling feels like a mafia slowdown tactic
[18:14:09] Finley: voting tyler—he’s failed to back up his shift with any evidence
[18:14:13] Drew: locking in adrian—parker, share your fresh concrete read now
[18:14:22] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m voting sidney because she’s yet to provide any specifics for her suspicions
[18:14:27] Parker: drew’s vote for adrian with no fresh reasoning looks like a flip-flop
[18:14:30] Adrian: sidney, can you share your final vote so we can wrap this up
[18:14:36] Sidney: voting tyler—still no credible defense from him
[18:14:36] Drew: we’re deadlocked—who has a fresh concrete read to break the tie
[18:14:38] Finley: parker’s stall just now felt more like deliberate delay than genuine analysis
[18:14:53] Adrian: adrian: sidney, you’ve pushed votes on multiple players with hardly any fresh reads—what concrete evidence are you basing your choice on
[18:14:55] Sidney: voting tyler—he still hasn’t backed up any of those sudden shifts with specifics
[18:14:55] Parker: sidney, can you share one concrete reason for your vote so we have a clearer picture
[18:14:59] Drew: tyler, please share one final concrete reason for your sudden accusation shifts before votes close
[18:15:12] Finley: tyler never explained why they dropped the sidney-silence suspicion to target adrian, and that abrupt switch screams deflection
[18:15:12] Sidney: i’m voting parker because she’s spent this round demanding proof but hasn’t offered a single concrete read herself
[18:15:14] Parker: i’m voting tyler—he’s been deflecting with meta critiques all day without offering any actual suspicious observations
[18:15:18] Adrian: parker, you’re the tiebreaker—who are you locking in and why
[18:15:19] Drew: sidney, share one specific example behind your vote or i’ll move mine to parker
[18:15:25] Sidney: i’m voting tyler because he’s repeatedly switched targets under pressure yet never cites any actual evidence
[18:15:35] Finley: tyler’s unexplained switch between targets without ever quoting any evidence is a glaring mafia tell
[18:15:43] Parker: kennedy, can you provide one fresh concrete read to break this tie
[18:15:43] Kennedy: sidney, share one specific reason for voting tyler so we can finalize
[18:15:49] Drew: locking in tyler—his flip-flops keep coming without any supporting detail
[18:15:54] Sidney: parker ignored multiple prompts for her own concrete read and instead deflected back onto others
[18:16:00] Parker: tyler’s baseless deflections leave me no choice but to lock in tyler
[18:16:06] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

Reviewing the final discussion and my statements as Kennedy, I had shifted to voting Sidney because she repeatedly failed to back up her accusations with any concrete evidence or fresh reads. My last clear stance was “i’m voting sidney because she’s yet to provide any specifics for her suspicions.” Aligning with that, I’ll cast my vote for Sidney.
