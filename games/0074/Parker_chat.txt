[18:05:11] Parker: morning everyone, any thoughts on who's acting suspicious so far
[18:05:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been unusually quiet so far
[18:05:34] Parker: tyler’s rush to accuse adrian feels off
[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:13:34] Parker: two different votes locked with zero discussion—can we each share a fresh concrete read before locking in
[18:14:08] Parker: i’m voting adrian; he’s only repeated tyler’s deflections instead of offering any independent reasoning
[18:14:27] Parker: drew’s vote for adrian with no fresh reasoning looks like a flip-flop
[18:14:55] Parker: sidney, can you share one concrete reason for your vote so we have a clearer picture
[18:15:14] Parker: i’m voting tyler—he’s been deflecting with meta critiques all day without offering any actual suspicious observations
[18:15:43] Parker: kennedy, can you provide one fresh concrete read to break this tie
[18:16:00] Parker: tyler’s baseless deflections leave me no choice but to lock in tyler
