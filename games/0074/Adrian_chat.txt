[18:05:09] Adrian: can we each share any suspicions we have so far to kick things off
[18:05:19] Adrian: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been really quiet today, what do you all think
[18:05:35] Adrian: tyler, why am i more suspicious than parker, who’s barely chimed in
[18:05:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—why zero in on tyler now
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:13:18] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because his abrupt flip-flops have no credible backing
[18:13:41] Adrian: locking in tyler—he’s offered zero justification for his rapid accusations
[18:13:55] Adrian: adrian: voting tyler—his constant flip-flops lack any substantive proof
[18:14:08] Adrian: my fresh read: parker’s procedural stalling feels like a mafia slowdown tactic
[18:14:30] Adrian: sidney, can you share your final vote so we can wrap this up
[18:14:53] Adrian: adrian: sidney, you’ve pushed votes on multiple players with hardly any fresh reads—what concrete evidence are you basing your choice on
[18:15:18] Adrian: parker, you’re the tiebreaker—who are you locking in and why
