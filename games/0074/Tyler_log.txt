## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

Yes, I understand the rules! We have Daytime where everyone discusses and votes to eliminate a suspect, and Nighttime where the mafia choose a bystander to remove. The mafia win if they reach parity with the bystanders; the bystanders win if they vote out all mafia. Ready to play!

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander.

The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

## CONTENT: Your name is Tyler.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:05:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown

In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

## CONTENT: Your name is Tyler.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:05:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown
 Kennedy unknown
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown
 Kennedy unknown
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

## CONTENT: Your name is Tyler.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:05:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown
 Kennedy unknown
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown

 Kennedy unknown
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection

## CONTENT: Your name is Tyler.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:05:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown

 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response.

[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—why zero in on tyler now
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up

[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something

[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian

[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia

## CONTENT: Your name is Tyler.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:05:00].

[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up

[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here

[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia

## CONTENT: Your name is Tyler.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:05:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown
 Kennedy unknown
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up

The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion

## CONTENT: Your name is Tyler.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:05:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown

The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch

## CONTENT: Your name is Tyler.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:05:00].

[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection

[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds

[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—why zero in on tyler now
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:00] Sidney: tyler’s abrupt switch to accusing adrian feels like misdirection
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way

[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious

[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence

[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch

## CONTENT: Your name is Tyler.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [18:05:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown
 Kennedy unknown
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown
 Kennedy unknown
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him

[18:05:06] Drew: alright everyone, who’s your top lynch candidate
[18:05:08] Kennedy: day three: who’s drawing your suspicion so far
[18:05:08] Finley: hey everyone, who should we consider first for a vote
[18:05:09] Sidney: feels quiet—does anyone have any early suspicions
[18:05:09] Adrian: can we each share any suspicions we have so far to kick things off
[18:05:11] Parker: morning everyone, any thoughts on who's acting suspicious so far
[18:05:12] Drew: any initial gut feelings on who's mafia
[18:05:14] Kennedy: i’m leaning towards parker—his silence is suspicious
[18:05:16] Tyler: i’m leaning toward adrian—he’s been awfully quiet
[18:05:17] Finley: parker’s awfully quiet—any thoughts on why
[18:05:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been unusually quiet so far
[18:05:19] Adrian: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been really quiet today, what do you all think
[18:05:24] Sidney: parker’s been awfully quiet—anyone else suspicious of them
[18:05:25] Kennedy: i’m leaning parker—they’ve been awfully generic and haven’t shared anything substantial
[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection
[18:05:32] Drew: let’s start by voting parker up and see how he defends himself
[18:05:34] Parker: tyler’s rush to accuse adrian feels off
[18:05:35] Adrian: tyler, why am i more suspicious than parker, who’s barely chimed in
[18:05:36] Sidney: i’m not sold on tyler either—can we dig deeper into kennedy’s concerns about parker
[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—why zero in on tyler now
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:00] Sidney: tyler’s abrupt switch to accusing adrian feels like misdirection
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him

## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, let's think about your response step-by-step. You have been given a  hidden sctrachpad where you can detail your steps / reasoning behind your response. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Use this scratchpad to think about your response, and then write your final response. 
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.
