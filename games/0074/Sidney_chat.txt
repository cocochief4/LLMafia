[18:05:09] Sidney: feels quiet—does anyone have any early suspicions
[18:05:24] Sidney: parker’s been awfully quiet—anyone else suspicious of them
[18:05:36] Sidney: i’m not sold on tyler either—can we dig deeper into kennedy’s concerns about parker
[18:06:00] Sidney: tyler’s abrupt switch to accusing adrian feels like misdirection
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:13:20] Sidney: adrian, drew, and kennedy—please cast your votes now
[18:13:37] Sidney: let’s hear from parker before we cast any more votes since they’ve been strangely silent today
[18:13:53] Sidney: adrian, drew, kennedy—let’s each share one fresh concrete read now
[18:14:36] Sidney: voting tyler—still no credible defense from him
[18:14:55] Sidney: voting tyler—he still hasn’t backed up any of those sudden shifts with specifics
[18:15:12] Sidney: i’m voting parker because she’s spent this round demanding proof but hasn’t offered a single concrete read herself
[18:15:25] Sidney: i’m voting tyler because he’s repeatedly switched targets under pressure yet never cites any actual evidence
[18:15:54] Sidney: parker ignored multiple prompts for her own concrete read and instead deflected back onto others
