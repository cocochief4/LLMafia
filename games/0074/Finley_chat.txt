[18:05:08] Finley: hey everyone, who should we consider first for a vote
[18:05:17] Finley: parker’s awfully quiet—any thoughts on why
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:13:22] Finley: voting tyler—no quote, no defense
[18:13:52] Finley: i’ll stick with tyler—he’s dodged multiple requests to actually cite any evidence for his sudden flips
[18:14:09] Finley: voting tyler—he’s failed to back up his shift with any evidence
[18:14:38] Finley: parker’s stall just now felt more like deliberate delay than genuine analysis
[18:15:12] Finley: tyler never explained why they dropped the sidney-silence suspicion to target adrian, and that abrupt switch screams deflection
[18:15:35] Finley: tyler’s unexplained switch between targets without ever quoting any evidence is a glaring mafia tell
