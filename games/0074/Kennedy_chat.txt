[18:05:08] Kennedy: day three: who’s drawing your suspicion so far
[18:05:14] Kennedy: i’m leaning towards parker—his silence is suspicious
[18:05:25] Kennedy: i’m leaning parker—they’ve been awfully generic and haven’t shared anything substantial
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:13:18] Kennedy: locking in my vote on adrian for offering no independent reads
[18:13:40] Kennedy: can we all share our current vote and one concise reason before we lock in
[18:13:53] Kennedy: parker, please share your fresh concrete read so we can finalize our votes
[18:14:04] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian—he’s just mirrored tyler’s points instead of offering his own analysis
[18:14:22] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m voting sidney because she’s yet to provide any specifics for her suspicions
[18:15:43] Kennedy: sidney, share one specific reason for voting tyler so we can finalize
