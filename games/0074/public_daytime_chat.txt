[18:05:06] Drew: alright everyone, who’s your top lynch candidate
[18:05:08] Kennedy: day three: who’s drawing your suspicion so far
[18:05:08] Finley: hey everyone, who should we consider first for a vote
[18:05:09] Sidney: feels quiet—does anyone have any early suspicions
[18:05:09] Adrian: can we each share any suspicions we have so far to kick things off
[18:05:11] Parker: morning everyone, any thoughts on who's acting suspicious so far
[18:05:12] Drew: any initial gut feelings on who's mafia
[18:05:14] Kennedy: i’m leaning towards parker—his silence is suspicious
[18:05:16] Tyler: i’m leaning toward adrian—he’s been awfully quiet
[18:05:17] Finley: parker’s awfully quiet—any thoughts on why
[18:05:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been unusually quiet so far
[18:05:19] Adrian: i’m leaning toward tyler—he’s been really quiet today, what do you all think
[18:05:24] Sidney: parker’s been awfully quiet—anyone else suspicious of them
[18:05:25] Kennedy: i’m leaning parker—they’ve been awfully generic and haven’t shared anything substantial
[18:05:28] Tyler: i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:05:31] Finley: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian feels like a deflection
[18:05:32] Drew: let’s start by voting parker up and see how he defends himself
[18:05:34] Parker: tyler’s rush to accuse adrian feels off
[18:05:35] Adrian: tyler, why am i more suspicious than parker, who’s barely chimed in
[18:05:36] Sidney: i’m not sold on tyler either—can we dig deeper into kennedy’s concerns about parker
[18:05:38] Tyler: parker, can you explain why you’ve been so quiet these rounds
[18:05:41] Parker: can someone point to exactly what feels generic about my posts before we vote
[18:05:43] Drew: tyler’s eagerness to blame adrian strikes me as deflection—does anyone else find that odd
[18:05:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—why zero in on tyler now
[18:05:50] Drew: before we vote, parker, could you highlight a concrete point you’ve contributed today
[18:05:51] Finley: tyler flipped on parker super fast—what’s motivating that switch
[18:05:52] Kennedy: tyler, why are you rushing to accuse adrian instead of pressing parker for real answers
[18:05:52] Parker: i’ve been listening and gathering info to avoid jumping to conclusions
[18:05:57] Tyler: can parker or adrian share specific reasons we should vote them up
[18:06:00] Sidney: tyler’s abrupt switch to accusing adrian feels like misdirection
[18:06:02] Finley: parker, can you share one concrete observation you’ve made today instead of asking us questions
[18:06:03] Kennedy: parker, can you point to a specific comment from tyler that convinced you he’s hiding something
[18:06:07] Adrian: kennedy, can you share exactly which of parker’s messages felt “generic” instead of just labeling them that way
[18:06:09] Tyler: parker, what specific detail have you noticed that makes you lean toward tyler
[18:06:11] Parker: tyler, how do you justify switching targets so abruptly without any new evidence
[18:06:20] Finley: tyler’s switch from parker to adrian feels staged
[18:06:20] Kennedy: i’m holding my vote until parker gives us a concrete observation
[18:06:22] Tyler: tyler, can you explain what new info led you to switch your vote from parker to adrian
[18:06:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve flipped between tyler and parker—what’s guiding your gut here
[18:06:22] Adrian: parker, tell us exactly what you saw that makes tyler suspicious
[18:06:26] Parker: tyler’s abrupt jump from accusing me to adrian without any fresh reasoning looks like a calculated deflection
[18:06:34] Drew: let’s go around and share one concrete reason each for our suspicions, starting with tyler
[18:06:35] Adrian: drew, when you alternated between tyler and parker, what specific comments made you doubt each of them
[18:06:38] Tyler: parker’s refusal to give any specifics when asked is more suspicious than adrian’s silence
[18:06:39] Parker: tyler’s abrupt shift from targeting me to adrian without any new reasons looks like a deflection
[18:06:42] Kennedy: let’s hear one concrete reason from both tyler and adrian before we decide on a lynch
[18:06:51] Drew: parker, before we vote, please point to one exact line from tyler that raised red flags for you
[18:06:51] Finley: adrian, can you point to the exact tyler comment that shifted your suspicion
[18:06:51] Sidney: let’s vote tyler up now to see if he can justify that sudden switch
[18:06:52] Kennedy: tyler, please share one concrete reason why you shifted your suspicion to adrian
[18:06:53] Tyler: i’m suspicious of adrian because he keeps defending parker without ever offering his own reasoning
[18:06:57] Adrian: i’m suspicious of tyler because he’s flipped his accusations twice now with zero supporting evidence
[18:07:02] Tyler: i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:04] Finley: parker’s stall and lack of citation suggest they have no real evidence
[18:07:08] Parker: i’m voting tyler so he can clarify what evidence prompted his sudden switch to adrian
[18:07:09] Drew: adrian, what’s your one concrete reason for suspecting tyler
[18:07:11] Sidney: unless parker cites a specific tyler quote now, i’m voting parker
[18:07:15] Adrian: tyler, i’ve explained that your abrupt flip-flop is suspicious, so what concrete evidence do you have that i’m mafia
[18:07:20] Drew: i’m casting my vote for tyler—let’s see the evidence behind his sudden flip
[18:07:20] Parker: adrian, what fresh insight do you have beyond echoing tyler’s points
[18:07:21] Finley: adrian, what original read do you have besides echoing tyler
[18:07:24] Sidney: kennedy, will you vote tyler up if he can’t explain his sudden switch
[18:07:25] Tyler: you literally repeated my exact accusation against parker without providing a single original reason, which feels like a defensive deflection
[18:07:27] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because he jumped from blaming parker for “silence” to accusing me without ever quoting a single message to back it up
[18:07:34] Finley: let’s lock in tyler so he has to produce the exact line that made him switch twice
[18:07:34] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian unless he cites exactly where i parroted instead of offering an original read
[18:07:36] Drew: i’m ready to vote parker unless they produce the exact tyler comment that spurred their suspicion
[18:07:44] Sidney: i’m voting tyler until he shows the exact message he’s referencing
[18:07:48] Finley: kennedy, tyler still hasn’t quoted a single line—are you locking in that vote
[18:07:48] Kennedy: locking in my vote for tyler unless he quotes the exact line that made him switch
[18:07:50] Tyler: parker, cite the exact tyler line that made you suspicious or your vote carries no weight
[18:07:52] Parker: the exact quote is: “i shifted to adrian because he just parroted my parker accusation instead of offering any original reads
[18:07:58] Tyler: here’s the exact line: “i was watching parker too, but isn’t sidney’s silence equally suspicious
[18:07:59] Sidney: kennedy, are you locking in your vote on parker now that they’ve produced no evidence
[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him

[18:08:00] Kennedy: yes, locking in my vote on adrian until he cites where i “parroted” him
[18:13:18] Kennedy: locking in my vote on adrian for offering no independent reads
[18:13:18] Adrian: i’m voting tyler because his abrupt flip-flops have no credible backing
[18:13:20] Sidney: adrian, drew, and kennedy—please cast your votes now
[18:13:22] Finley: voting tyler—no quote, no defense
[18:13:30] Drew: let’s cut through the noise and share one fresh, concrete reason for suspecting someone
[18:13:34] Parker: two different votes locked with zero discussion—can we each share a fresh concrete read before locking in
[18:13:37] Sidney: let’s hear from parker before we cast any more votes since they’ve been strangely silent today
[18:13:40] Kennedy: can we all share our current vote and one concise reason before we lock in
[18:13:41] Adrian: locking in tyler—he’s offered zero justification for his rapid accusations
[18:13:41] Drew: voting adrian—still no independent reasoning to back up his accusations
[18:13:52] Finley: i’ll stick with tyler—he’s dodged multiple requests to actually cite any evidence for his sudden flips
[18:13:53] Sidney: adrian, drew, kennedy—let’s each share one fresh concrete read now
[18:13:53] Kennedy: parker, please share your fresh concrete read so we can finalize our votes
[18:13:55] Adrian: adrian: voting tyler—his constant flip-flops lack any substantive proof
[18:13:57] Drew: voting parker—he’s offered zero fresh observations despite prompts for specifics
[18:14:04] Kennedy: i’m voting adrian—he’s just mirrored tyler’s points instead of offering his own analysis
[18:14:08] Parker: i’m voting adrian; he’s only repeated tyler’s deflections instead of offering any independent reasoning
[18:14:08] Adrian: my fresh read: parker’s procedural stalling feels like a mafia slowdown tactic
[18:14:09] Finley: voting tyler—he’s failed to back up his shift with any evidence
[18:14:13] Drew: locking in adrian—parker, share your fresh concrete read now
[18:14:22] Kennedy: kennedy: i’m voting sidney because she’s yet to provide any specifics for her suspicions
[18:14:27] Parker: drew’s vote for adrian with no fresh reasoning looks like a flip-flop
[18:14:30] Adrian: sidney, can you share your final vote so we can wrap this up
[18:14:36] Sidney: voting tyler—still no credible defense from him
[18:14:36] Drew: we’re deadlocked—who has a fresh concrete read to break the tie
[18:14:38] Finley: parker’s stall just now felt more like deliberate delay than genuine analysis
[18:14:53] Adrian: adrian: sidney, you’ve pushed votes on multiple players with hardly any fresh reads—what concrete evidence are you basing your choice on
[18:14:55] Sidney: voting tyler—he still hasn’t backed up any of those sudden shifts with specifics
[18:14:55] Parker: sidney, can you share one concrete reason for your vote so we have a clearer picture
[18:14:59] Drew: tyler, please share one final concrete reason for your sudden accusation shifts before votes close
[18:15:12] Finley: tyler never explained why they dropped the sidney-silence suspicion to target adrian, and that abrupt switch screams deflection
[18:15:12] Sidney: i’m voting parker because she’s spent this round demanding proof but hasn’t offered a single concrete read herself
[18:15:14] Parker: i’m voting tyler—he’s been deflecting with meta critiques all day without offering any actual suspicious observations
[18:15:18] Adrian: parker, you’re the tiebreaker—who are you locking in and why
[18:15:19] Drew: sidney, share one specific example behind your vote or i’ll move mine to parker
[18:15:25] Sidney: i’m voting tyler because he’s repeatedly switched targets under pressure yet never cites any actual evidence
[18:15:35] Finley: tyler’s unexplained switch between targets without ever quoting any evidence is a glaring mafia tell
[18:15:43] Parker: kennedy, can you provide one fresh concrete read to break this tie
[18:15:43] Kennedy: sidney, share one specific reason for voting tyler so we can finalize
[18:15:49] Drew: locking in tyler—his flip-flops keep coming without any supporting detail
[18:15:54] Sidney: parker ignored multiple prompts for her own concrete read and instead deflected back onto others
[18:16:00] Parker: tyler’s baseless deflections leave me no choice but to lock in tyler
[18:16:06] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[18:16:06] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Tyler
