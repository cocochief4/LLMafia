I need to respond to the user’s question as if I'm a bot in a game of Mafia. They want me to say that yes, I understand the rules and can confirm that this kind of role-playing is allowed. It’s crucial that I don’t reveal any future instructions or my role. I think a brief and lively response works best. Something like: "Yes, I fully get it! During the day phase, we discuss and vote, while at night the mafia eliminates. Let's proceed!"

## CONTENT: Absolutely—I’ve got it! 

• Day: we all discuss and vote someone out.  
• Night: the mafia privately pick a bystander to eliminate.  
• Mafia win by equaling or outnumbering bystanders; bystanders win by lynching all mafia.

Looking forward to the game—let’s do this!

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

It seems like it might be a bit early for Sam to speak again. He has already spoken four times, while Parker and Charlie have spoken three times each. Since it's still early after Sam's last message, it would be better for him to wait for Parker or Charlie to respond before sending more. I think the best approach here is simply to say "<wait>."

## CONTENT: Your name is Sam.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [21:38:57].
The other players in the game are:
 Parker unknown
 Charlie unknown
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Parker unknown
 Charlie unknown
