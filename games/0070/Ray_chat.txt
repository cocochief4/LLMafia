[16:38:22] Ray: any early thoughts on who we should keep an eye on
[16:38:29] Ray: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—any thoughts on who we should target
[16:38:50] Ray: dakota, you’ve been quiet so far—who are you most suspicious of
[16:39:11] Ray: sam, can you point to a moment when parker’s silence felt suspicious to you
[16:39:26] Ray: sam’s tunnel vision on parker with no proof looks suspicious
[16:39:39] Ray: kennedy, your constant questioning everyone else while staying quiet yourself seems more suspicious than parker’s silence
[16:39:56] Ray: kennedy, are you on board investigating sam next
[16:40:08] Ray: sam, if you had to vote someone out right now, who would it be
[16:41:28] Ray: i’m voting sam—dakota, are you with me
[16:41:38] Ray: i’m leaning toward voting sam next since they haven’t offered any concrete evidence for their accusations
[16:41:53] Ray: dakota, sam’s constant flip-flopping on who to vote out with zero rationale feels really suspect—what do you think
[16:42:09] Ray: sam has flip-flopped from parker to me to you, dakota, all with zero proof
[16:42:37] Ray: sam accused parker then pivoted to questioning both of us within minutes with zero evidence each time
