## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you must explain your reasoning behind your words and actions. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to explain your reasoning before you respond.
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:38:15].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray 
 Parker 
 Sam 
 Dakota 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:

In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you must explain your reasoning behind your words and actions. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to explain your reasoning before you respond.
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:38:15].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray 
 Parker 
 Sam 
 Dakota 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Ray 
 Parker 
 Sam 
 Dakota 
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you must explain your reasoning behind your words and actions. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to explain your reasoning before you respond.
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[16:38:15] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 2.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:38:22] Ray: any early thoughts on who we should keep an eye on
[16:38:23] Sam: hey everyone—any initial reads on who might be acting suspicious
[16:38:23] Parker: morning everyone—anyone stand out as suspicious so far
[16:38:23] Dakota: hey everyone, good luck and let’s have fun
[16:38:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, any thoughts on who looks suspicious so far
[16:38:29] Ray: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—any thoughts on who we should target
[16:38:33] Sam: i’m watching parker—they’ve been awfully quiet so far
[16:38:34] Parker: i noticed kennedy’s been awfully quiet—what’s everyone’s take on that
[16:38:35] Kennedy: hey—noticed ray and parker were quick to ask about suspects; what’s catching your eye
[16:38:37] Dakota: anyone notice anything weird overnight
[16:38:42] Kennedy: ray’s eagerness to nail parker feels odd—anyone else notice

[16:38:47] Dakota: kennedy, what about ray and parker’s quick questions seems suspicious to you
[16:38:50] Ray: dakota, you’ve been quiet so far—who are you most suspicious of
[16:38:53] Parker: why is ray so quick to accuse parker
[16:38:55] Sam: parker, you keep deflecting instead of suggesting real suspects, which feels off
[16:39:04] Dakota: i’m actually curious why sam is zeroing in on parker without offering any alternative suspects
[16:39:08] Sam: ray’s quick accusations feel off—what could he be deflecting from
[16:39:09] Kennedy: parker, if you’re not mafia, who do you think we should investigate next
[16:39:11] Ray: sam, can you point to a moment when parker’s silence felt suspicious to you
[16:39:14] Parker: kennedy’s constant finger-pointing seems odd—thoughts

[16:39:20] Kennedy: dakota, what do you make of sam flipping from parker to ray
[16:39:26] Ray: sam’s tunnel vision on parker with no proof looks suspicious
[16:39:28] Kennedy: i’m curious, parker—if it’s not me or ray, who would you vote for
[16:39:29] Parker: i think we should investigate dakota next since they haven’t offered any solid observations
[16:39:36] Sam: dakota, what makes parker’s deflections more suspicious than ray’s rushing to accuse

[16:39:38] Parker: i’m leaning toward investigating sam—his shifting accusations lack substance
[16:39:39] Ray: kennedy, your constant questioning everyone else while staying quiet yourself seems more suspicious than parker’s silence

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:38:15].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray 
 Parker 
 Sam 
 Dakota 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Ray 
 Parker 
 Sam 
 Dakota 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you must explain your reasoning behind your words and actions. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to explain your reasoning before you respond.
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:38:15].
The other players in the game are:
 Ray 
 Parker 
 Sam 
 Dakota 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Ray 
 Parker 
 Sam 
 Dakota 
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you must explain your reasoning behind your words and actions. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to explain your reasoning before you respond.
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[16:39:09] Kennedy: parker, if you’re not mafia, who do you think we should investigate next
[16:39:11] Ray: sam, can you point to a moment when parker’s silence felt suspicious to you
[16:39:14] Parker: kennedy’s constant finger-pointing seems odd—thoughts
[16:39:20] Dakota: i’m leaning toward parker given all the deflections
[16:39:20] Kennedy: dakota, what do you make of sam flipping from parker to ray
[16:39:26] Ray: sam’s tunnel vision on parker with no proof looks suspicious
[16:39:28] Kennedy: i’m curious, parker—if it’s not me or ray, who would you vote for
[16:39:29] Parker: i think we should investigate dakota next since they haven’t offered any solid observations
[16:39:36] Sam: dakota, what makes parker’s deflections more suspicious than ray’s rushing to accuse
[16:39:36] Dakota: ray, rushing to blame parker without evidence seems suspicious
[16:39:38] Parker: i’m leaning toward investigating sam—his shifting accusations lack substance
[16:39:39] Ray: kennedy, your constant questioning everyone else while staying quiet yourself seems more suspicious than parker’s silence
[16:39:49] Dakota: who’s flip-flopped on suspects without giving any reasons
[16:39:52] Kennedy: parker, what exactly in sam’s shifting accusations makes you think they’re mafia
[16:39:54] Sam: parker, what’s catching your eye about dakota
[16:39:56] Ray: kennedy, are you on board investigating sam next
[16:40:04] Dakota: who here is actually voting for parker
[16:40:04] Kennedy: does anyone have concrete examples of suspicious behavior from ray to support that claim
[16:40:06] Sam: my accusations kept shifting with no evidence, which reads like a deliberate distraction
[16:40:08] Ray: sam, if you had to vote someone out right now, who would it be
[16:40:11] Parker: dakota hasn’t provided any original reasoning, only bandwagoned on others’ claims
[16:40:12] Kennedy: i’m voting sam—who’s with me
[16:40:15] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
