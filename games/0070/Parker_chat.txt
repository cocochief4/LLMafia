[16:38:23] Parker: morning everyone—anyone stand out as suspicious so far
[16:38:34] Parker: i noticed kennedy’s been awfully quiet—what’s everyone’s take on that
[16:38:43] Parker: okay—what exactly in my posts so far seems suspicious
[16:38:53] Parker: why is ray so quick to accuse parker
[16:39:14] Parker: kennedy’s constant finger-pointing seems odd—thoughts
[16:39:29] Parker: i think we should investigate dakota next since they haven’t offered any solid observations
[16:39:38] Parker: i’m leaning toward investigating sam—his shifting accusations lack substance
[16:40:11] Parker: dakota hasn’t provided any original reasoning, only bandwagoned on others’ claims
