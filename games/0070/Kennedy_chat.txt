[16:38:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, any thoughts on who looks suspicious so far
[16:38:35] Kennedy: hey—noticed ray and parker were quick to ask about suspects; what’s catching your eye
[16:38:42] Kennedy: ray’s eagerness to nail parker feels odd—anyone else notice
[16:39:09] Kennedy: parker, if you’re not mafia, who do you think we should investigate next
[16:39:20] Kennedy: dakota, what do you make of sam flipping from parker to ray
[16:39:28] Kennedy: i’m curious, parker—if it’s not me or ray, who would you vote for
[16:39:52] Kennedy: parker, what exactly in sam’s shifting accusations makes you think they’re mafia
[16:40:04] Kennedy: does anyone have concrete examples of suspicious behavior from ray to support that claim
[16:40:12] Kennedy: i’m voting sam—who’s with me
