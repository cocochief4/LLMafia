[16:38:23] Dakota: hey everyone, good luck and let’s have fun
[16:38:37] Dakota: anyone notice anything weird overnight
[16:38:47] Dakota: kennedy, what about ray and parker’s quick questions seems suspicious to you
[16:39:04] Dakota: i’m actually curious why sam is zeroing in on parker without offering any alternative suspects
[16:39:20] Dakota: i’m leaning toward parker given all the deflections
[16:39:36] Dakota: ray, rushing to blame parker without evidence seems suspicious
[16:39:49] Dakota: who’s flip-flopped on suspects without giving any reasons
[16:40:04] Dakota: who here is actually voting for parker
[16:41:24] Dakota: i’m already eyeing sam for tomorrow’s vote
[16:41:42] Dakota: ray, can you give a concrete example of sam’s suspicious behavior
[16:42:01] Dakota: ray, what specific behavior makes you so certain sam is mafia
[16:42:21] Dakota: sam, can you clarify why you’ve flip-flopped targets twice now with no reasoning
[16:42:38] Dakota: sam, why should we trust your sudden focus on ray after previously targeting parker
[16:42:57] Dakota: can someone make a strong case against ray before we just vote for sam
