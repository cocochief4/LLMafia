[16:38:22] Ray: any early thoughts on who we should keep an eye on
[16:38:23] Sam: hey everyone—any initial reads on who might be acting suspicious
[16:38:23] Parker: morning everyone—anyone stand out as suspicious so far
[16:38:23] Dakota: hey everyone, good luck and let’s have fun
[16:38:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, any thoughts on who looks suspicious so far
[16:38:29] Ray: parker, you’ve been awfully quiet—any thoughts on who we should target
[16:38:33] Sam: i’m watching parker—they’ve been awfully quiet so far
[16:38:34] Parker: i noticed kennedy’s been awfully quiet—what’s everyone’s take on that
[16:38:35] Kennedy: hey—noticed ray and parker were quick to ask about suspects; what’s catching your eye
[16:38:37] Dakota: anyone notice anything weird overnight
[16:38:42] Kennedy: ray’s eagerness to nail parker feels odd—anyone else notice
[16:38:43] Parker: okay—what exactly in my posts so far seems suspicious
[16:38:44] Sam: parker, what’s your gut feeling—anybody’s behavior raising red flags for you
[16:38:47] Dakota: kennedy, what about ray and parker’s quick questions seems suspicious to you
[16:38:50] Ray: dakota, you’ve been quiet so far—who are you most suspicious of
[16:38:53] Parker: why is ray so quick to accuse parker
[16:38:55] Sam: parker, you keep deflecting instead of suggesting real suspects, which feels off
[16:39:04] Dakota: i’m actually curious why sam is zeroing in on parker without offering any alternative suspects
[16:39:08] Sam: ray’s quick accusations feel off—what could he be deflecting from
[16:39:09] Kennedy: parker, if you’re not mafia, who do you think we should investigate next
[16:39:11] Ray: sam, can you point to a moment when parker’s silence felt suspicious to you
[16:39:14] Parker: kennedy’s constant finger-pointing seems odd—thoughts
[16:39:20] Dakota: i’m leaning toward parker given all the deflections
[16:39:20] Kennedy: dakota, what do you make of sam flipping from parker to ray
[16:39:26] Ray: sam’s tunnel vision on parker with no proof looks suspicious
[16:39:28] Kennedy: i’m curious, parker—if it’s not me or ray, who would you vote for
[16:39:29] Parker: i think we should investigate dakota next since they haven’t offered any solid observations
[16:39:36] Sam: dakota, what makes parker’s deflections more suspicious than ray’s rushing to accuse
[16:39:36] Dakota: ray, rushing to blame parker without evidence seems suspicious
[16:39:38] Parker: i’m leaning toward investigating sam—his shifting accusations lack substance
[16:39:39] Ray: kennedy, your constant questioning everyone else while staying quiet yourself seems more suspicious than parker’s silence
[16:39:49] Dakota: who’s flip-flopped on suspects without giving any reasons
[16:39:52] Kennedy: parker, what exactly in sam’s shifting accusations makes you think they’re mafia
[16:39:54] Sam: parker, what’s catching your eye about dakota
[16:39:56] Ray: kennedy, are you on board investigating sam next
[16:40:04] Dakota: who here is actually voting for parker
[16:40:04] Kennedy: does anyone have concrete examples of suspicious behavior from ray to support that claim
[16:40:06] Sam: my accusations kept shifting with no evidence, which reads like a deliberate distraction
[16:40:08] Ray: sam, if you had to vote someone out right now, who would it be
[16:40:11] Parker: dakota hasn’t provided any original reasoning, only bandwagoned on others’ claims
[16:40:12] Kennedy: i’m voting sam—who’s with me
[16:40:15] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:40:25] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sam
[16:40:27] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Parker
[16:40:29] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Parker
[16:40:33] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Sam
[16:40:40] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Dakota
[16:41:24] Dakota: i’m already eyeing sam for tomorrow’s vote
[16:41:26] Sam: losing two innocents back to back—ray, who stands out to you now
[16:41:28] Ray: i’m voting sam—dakota, are you with me
[16:41:36] Sam: dakota, what evidence is making you eye me this time
[16:41:38] Ray: i’m leaning toward voting sam next since they haven’t offered any concrete evidence for their accusations
[16:41:42] Dakota: ray, can you give a concrete example of sam’s suspicious behavior
[16:41:47] Sam: ray, what fresh evidence are you basing your vote on
[16:41:53] Ray: dakota, sam’s constant flip-flopping on who to vote out with zero rationale feels really suspect—what do you think
[16:42:01] Dakota: ray, what specific behavior makes you so certain sam is mafia
[16:42:09] Ray: sam has flip-flopped from parker to me to you, dakota, all with zero proof
[16:42:21] Dakota: sam, can you clarify why you’ve flip-flopped targets twice now with no reasoning
[16:42:28] Sam: ray and dakota, your synchronized push for my lynching looks planned—why are you voting together
[16:42:37] Ray: sam accused parker then pivoted to questioning both of us within minutes with zero evidence each time
[16:42:38] Dakota: sam, why should we trust your sudden focus on ray after previously targeting parker
[16:42:51] Sam: i shifted suspects to gauge reactions, and ray’s baseless accusations now make him my top suspect
[16:42:57] Dakota: can someone make a strong case against ray before we just vote for sam
[16:42:59] Sam: ray, dakota, can either of you point to a single behavior from me that only mafia would exhibit
[16:43:10] Sam: ray's baseless deflections and empty accusations scream mafia more than my flip-flops ever could
[16:43:12] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:43:24] Game-Manager: Sam voted for Ray
[16:43:26] Game-Manager: Ray voted for Sam
[16:43:30] Game-Manager: Dakota voted for Sam
