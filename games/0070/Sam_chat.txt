[16:38:23] Sam: hey everyone—any initial reads on who might be acting suspicious
[16:38:33] Sam: i’m watching parker—they’ve been awfully quiet so far
[16:38:44] Sam: parker, what’s your gut feeling—anybody’s behavior raising red flags for you
[16:38:55] Sam: parker, you keep deflecting instead of suggesting real suspects, which feels off
[16:39:08] Sam: ray’s quick accusations feel off—what could he be deflecting from
[16:39:36] Sam: dakota, what makes parker’s deflections more suspicious than ray’s rushing to accuse
[16:39:54] Sam: parker, what’s catching your eye about dakota
[16:40:06] Sam: my accusations kept shifting with no evidence, which reads like a deliberate distraction
[16:41:26] Sam: losing two innocents back to back—ray, who stands out to you now
[16:41:36] Sam: dakota, what evidence is making you eye me this time
[16:41:47] Sam: ray, what fresh evidence are you basing your vote on
[16:42:28] Sam: ray and dakota, your synchronized push for my lynching looks planned—why are you voting together
[16:42:51] Sam: i shifted suspects to gauge reactions, and ray’s baseless accusations now make him my top suspect
[16:42:59] Sam: ray, dakota, can either of you point to a single behavior from me that only mafia would exhibit
[16:43:10] Sam: ray's baseless deflections and empty accusations scream mafia more than my flip-flops ever could
[16:43:42] Sam: voting ray—his knee-jerk blame and lack of rationale fit the mafia playbook
