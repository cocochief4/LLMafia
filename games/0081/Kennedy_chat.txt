[17:06:11] Kennedy: parker, any early suspicions on who might be the mafia
[17:06:37] Kennedy: tyler, any gut feeling on who we should lynch
[17:06:52] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward sidney for our first vote—any objections
[17:07:22] Kennedy: kennedy: sidney’s been uncannily quiet—anyone else flag that
[17:07:34] Kennedy: adrian’s asking nonstop yet still names no suspect—why the deflection
[17:07:58] Kennedy: notice parker and tyler echoing each other’s accusations of sidney without any new evidence
[17:08:14] Kennedy: i’m voting parker unless he explains his flip-flopping right now
[17:11:52] Kennedy: drew, now that two innocents are down, who’s on your radar
[17:12:03] Kennedy: voting tyler—baseless defense of finley looks like a mafia diversion
[17:12:49] Kennedy: adrian got killed for asking too many questions, so tyler’s defense of finley looks like misdirection
[17:13:18] Kennedy: i’m voting tyler because parroting finley instead of offering his own reasoning reeks of mafia coordination
[17:15:56] Kennedy: drew, you flip-flopped from tyler to me—what changed your mind
