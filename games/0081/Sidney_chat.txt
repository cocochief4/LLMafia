[17:06:08] Sidney: morning everyone, any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[17:06:21] Sidney: hey everyone, noticed kennedy’s been really quiet—innocent or suspicious
[17:06:43] Sidney: kennedy’s awfully quiet after that one question—anyone else notice
[17:07:18] Sidney: tyler, why the sudden switch from me to kennedy
[17:08:07] Sidney: adrian asking for suspects but never naming one himself seems odd—anyone else notice
[17:08:38] Sidney: sidney: i’m voting parker for flip-flopping targets with zero evidence
[17:08:53] Sidney: anyone else find parker’s eagerness to lynch kennedy without any solid proof way more alarming than kennedy’s quiet
[17:11:47] Sidney: voting tyler—too keen to defend finley
[17:12:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve asked for suspects but still haven’t named one yourself—who do you suspect
[17:12:46] Sidney: they targeted adrian because his endless questions without naming a suspect reeked of classic mafia misdirection
[17:14:16] Sidney: rather than deflect onto me, tyler, how do you account for the three votes stacked against you
[17:16:09] Sidney: drew, why keep voting kennedy when tyler’s parroting finley is far more suspicious
