## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. + 
 + Do you understand the rules? +

## CONTENT: Your name is Drew.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:05:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( unknown ) 
 Sidney ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Finley ( unknown ) 
 Tyler ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Adrian ( unknown ) 
Sidney ( unknown ) 
Parker ( unknown ) 
Finley ( unknown ) 
Tyler ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

## CONTENT: Your name is Drew.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[17:06:43] Sidney: kennedy’s awfully quiet after that one question—anyone else notice
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Make sure to say something every once in a while, and make yourself heard. Remember you like to be active in the game, so participate and be as talkative as other players! Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

## CONTENT: Your name is Drew.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:05:54].

## CONTENT: Your name is Drew.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

## CONTENT: Your name is Drew.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[17:05:54] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:06:01] Drew: hello everyone, any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[17:06:05] Finley: morning all—does anyone have any early suspicions
[17:06:06] Parker: alright everyone, who’s our top suspect for this first lynch
[17:06:08] Tyler: hey everyone, any early gut feelings on who might be mafia
[17:06:08] Sidney: morning everyone, any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[17:06:11] Kennedy: parker, any early suspicions on who might be the mafia
[17:06:13] Adrian: day one—who’s on your suspect list so far
[17:06:16] Drew: anybody else think someone’s been oddly quiet so far
[17:06:21] Sidney: hey everyone, noticed kennedy’s been really quiet—innocent or suspicious
[17:06:21] Finley: tyler’s awfully quiet, anyone else find that odd
[17:06:22] Tyler: i’ve got my eye on sidney—they’ve been awfully quiet so far
[17:06:24] Parker: morning—sidney’s quietness feels suspicious so far, anyone else notice
[17:06:34] Finley: kennedy, you’ve been quiet—who do you suspect
[17:06:35] Tyler: i’ve been quiet, but kennedy’s radio silence after that one question feels way more suspicious
[17:06:37] Kennedy: tyler, any gut feeling on who we should lynch
[17:06:43] Sidney: kennedy’s awfully quiet after that one question—anyone else notice
[17:06:45] Drew: parker, who’s your top suspect for today’s lynch
[17:06:46] Parker: kennedy barely chimed in—should we be wary of that
[17:06:48] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, tyler hasn’t offered any guesses yet—does that strike anyone as odd
[17:06:52] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward sidney for our first vote—any objections
[17:06:56] Finley: parker jumping on sidney so quickly feels off—anyone else notice
[17:07:00] Tyler: adrian’s been asking a lot but never names anyone—feels suspicious
[17:07:00] Drew: tyler’s quick to blame sidney—anyone else find that odd
[17:07:10] Adrian: anyone think we’re targeting kennedy just for being quiet
[17:07:18] Sidney: tyler, why the sudden switch from me to kennedy
[17:07:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward kennedy—anyone else notice their silence feels off
[17:07:19] Drew: adrian’s been asking a lot but still hasn’t named a suspect—why
[17:07:20] Finley: i’m not convinced sidney is mafia—anyone else think parker’s deflections are odd
[17:07:22] Kennedy: kennedy: sidney’s been uncannily quiet—anyone else flag that
[17:07:23] Tyler: why is parker so eager to lynch sidney—what’s his angle
[17:07:29] Adrian: kennedy’s sudden vote for sidney after being silent this whole time feels off—anyone else agree
[17:07:32] Parker: sidney raises a solid point—tyler, why the abrupt switch to kennedy
[17:07:33] Drew: anyone else find adrian’s eagerness without naming a suspect odd
[17:07:34] Kennedy: adrian’s asking nonstop yet still names no suspect—why the deflection
[17:07:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve flip-flopped between sidney and kennedy—what’s your actual read
[17:07:52] Parker: adrian, why do you think kennedy’s vote for sidney is so sudden
[17:07:53] Tyler: i’m with finley—parker’s sudden deflections feel more suspicious than sidney’s quiet

## CONTENT: Your name is Drew.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[17:06:13] Adrian: day one—who’s on your suspect list so far
[17:06:16] Drew: anybody else think someone’s been oddly quiet so far
[17:06:21] Sidney: hey everyone, noticed kennedy’s been really quiet—innocent or suspicious
[17:06:21] Finley: tyler’s awfully quiet, anyone else find that odd
[17:06:22] Tyler: i’ve got my eye on sidney—they’ve been awfully quiet so far
[17:06:24] Parker: morning—sidney’s quietness feels suspicious so far, anyone else notice
[17:06:34] Finley: kennedy, you’ve been quiet—who do you suspect
[17:06:35] Tyler: i’ve been quiet, but kennedy’s radio silence after that one question feels way more suspicious
[17:06:37] Kennedy: tyler, any gut feeling on who we should lynch
[17:06:43] Sidney: kennedy’s awfully quiet after that one question—anyone else notice
[17:06:45] Drew: parker, who’s your top suspect for today’s lynch
[17:06:46] Parker: kennedy barely chimed in—should we be wary of that
[17:06:48] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, tyler hasn’t offered any guesses yet—does that strike anyone as odd

[17:07:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward kennedy—anyone else notice their silence feels off
[17:07:19] Drew: adrian’s been asking a lot but still hasn’t named a suspect—why

[17:07:53] Tyler: i’m with finley—parker’s sudden deflections feel more suspicious than sidney’s quiet
[17:07:58] Kennedy: notice parker and tyler echoing each other’s accusations of sidney without any new evidence
[17:08:07] Sidney: adrian asking for suspects but never naming one himself seems odd—anyone else notice
[17:08:09] Finley: parker, your stalling feels dodgy—why haven’t you settled on one suspect
[17:08:11] Parker: i’m sticking with kennedy—her silence feels way more suspicious than sidney’s
[17:08:14] Kennedy: i’m voting parker unless he explains his flip-flopping right now

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[17:07:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve flip-flopped between sidney and kennedy—what’s your actual read
[17:07:52] Parker: adrian, why do you think kennedy’s vote for sidney is so sudden
[17:07:53] Tyler: i’m with finley—parker’s sudden deflections feel more suspicious than sidney’s quiet
[17:07:58] Kennedy: notice parker and tyler echoing each other’s accusations of sidney without any new evidence
[17:08:07] Sidney: adrian asking for suspects but never naming one himself seems odd—anyone else notice
[17:08:09] Finley: parker, your stalling feels dodgy—why haven’t you settled on one suspect
[17:08:11] Parker: i’m sticking with kennedy—her silence feels way more suspicious than sidney’s
[17:08:14] Kennedy: i’m voting parker unless he explains his flip-flopping right now
[17:08:15] Adrian: parker, why the sudden switch from sidney to kennedy
[17:08:33] Adrian: finley, what makes parker’s deflections more suspicious than kennedy’s silence
[17:08:38] Sidney: sidney: i’m voting parker for flip-flopping targets with zero evidence
[17:08:39] Drew: if we’re lynching sidney, what concrete evidence beyond silence do we have
[17:08:48] Tyler: drew, you kicked off this chat—who’s your top lynch choice
[17:08:53] Sidney: anyone else find parker’s eagerness to lynch kennedy without any solid proof way more alarming than kennedy’s quiet
[17:08:54] Parker: i won’t pick a suspect without solid evidence

## OPERATION: Complete Prompt to LLM
## CONTENT: Your name is Drew.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:05:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Finley ( unknown ) 
 Tyler ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Sidney ( unknown ) 
Finley ( unknown ) 
Tyler ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

## CONTENT: Your name is Drew.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:05:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( unknown )

## CONTENT: [Summary(text='**Analyzing player strategies**\n\nPlayers are considering what they learned from the last kill, like whether the mafia chose someone suspicious or went random. A good simplification could be, "Did we find any clues from last night\'s kill?" Another angle is asking Tyler and Finley for their top suspects now that two bystanders are gone.

The Game Master’s message suggests he was "voted out," but this seems confusing since they didn’t hold a vote after Parker\'s lynch. It likely means Adrian was killed at night. I want to keep the question straightforward, asking something like, "Why do we think the mafia picked Adrian last night?" Alternatively, I could shorten it to, "Any clue why the mafia chose Adrian last night?" Both options are clear and succinct for the players.', type='summary_text'), Summary(text='**Crafting the question for clarity**\n\nI\'m thinking about how to ask about the mafia\'s decision to target Adrian. I want to keep my question straightforward and specific to recent events, like asking, "Any clue why mafia chose Adrian last night?"

## CONTENT: Your name is Drew.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:05:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Finley ( unknown ) 
 Tyler ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Sidney ( unknown ) 
Finley ( unknown ) 
Tyler ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

[17:07:23] Tyler: why is parker so eager to lynch sidney—what’s his angle
[17:07:29] Adrian: kennedy’s sudden vote for sidney after being silent this whole time feels off—anyone else agree

[17:07:52] Parker: adrian, why do you think kennedy’s vote for sidney is so sudden
[17:07:53] Tyler: i’m with finley—parker’s sudden deflections feel more suspicious than sidney’s quiet
[17:07:58] Kennedy: notice parker and tyler echoing each other’s accusations of sidney without any new evidence

[17:08:54] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

[17:11:52] Kennedy: drew, now that two innocents are down, who’s on your radar
[17:12:03] Kennedy: voting tyler—baseless defense of finley looks like a mafia diversion
[17:12:04] Tyler: finley, who’s your top suspect after last night’s kill
[17:12:08] Finley: tyler’s quick to echo my points—what’s your angle here
[17:12:12] Drew: any clue why mafia chose adrian last night

## CONTENT: Your name is Drew.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:05:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( unknown )

[17:06:16] Drew: anybody else think someone’s been oddly quiet so far
[17:06:21] Sidney: hey everyone, noticed kennedy’s been really quiet—innocent or suspicious
[17:06:21] Finley: tyler’s awfully quiet, anyone else find that odd
[17:06:22] Tyler: i’ve got my eye on sidney—they’ve been awfully quiet so far
[17:06:24] Parker: morning—sidney’s quietness feels suspicious so far, anyone else notice
[17:06:34] Finley: kennedy, you’ve been quiet—who do you suspect
[17:06:35] Tyler: i’ve been quiet, but kennedy’s radio silence after that one question feels way more suspicious
[17:06:37] Kennedy: tyler, any gut feeling on who we should lynch
[17:06:43] Sidney: kennedy’s awfully quiet after that one question—anyone else notice
[17:06:45] Drew: parker, who’s your top suspect for today’s lynch
[17:06:46] Parker: kennedy barely chimed in—should we be wary of that
[17:06:48] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, tyler hasn’t offered any guesses yet—does that strike anyone as odd
[17:06:52] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward sidney for our first vote—any objections
[17:06:56] Finley: parker jumping on sidney so quickly feels off—anyone else notice
[17:07:00] Tyler: adrian’s been asking a lot but never names anyone—feels suspicious
[17:07:00] Drew: tyler’s quick to blame sidney—anyone else find that odd
[17:07:10] Adrian: anyone think we’re targeting kennedy just for being quiet
[17:07:18] Sidney: tyler, why the sudden switch from me to kennedy
[17:07:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward kennedy—anyone else notice their silence feels off
[17:07:19] Drew: adrian’s been asking a lot but still hasn’t named a suspect—why

[17:07:22] Kennedy: kennedy: sidney’s been uncannily quiet—anyone else flag that
[17:07:23] Tyler: why is parker so eager to lynch sidney—what’s his angle
[17:07:29] Adrian: kennedy’s sudden vote for sidney after being silent this whole time feels off—anyone else agree
[17:07:32] Parker: sidney raises a solid point—tyler, why the abrupt switch to kennedy
[17:07:33] Drew: anyone else find adrian’s eagerness without naming a suspect odd
[17:07:34] Kennedy: adrian’s asking nonstop yet still names no suspect—why the deflection
[17:07:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve flip-flopped between sidney and kennedy—what’s your actual read
[17:07:52] Parker: adrian, why do you think kennedy’s vote for sidney is so sudden
[17:07:53] Tyler: i’m with finley—parker’s sudden deflections feel more suspicious than sidney’s quiet
[17:07:58] Kennedy: notice parker and tyler echoing each other’s accusations of sidney without any new evidence
[17:08:07] Sidney: adrian asking for suspects but never naming one himself seems odd—anyone else notice
[17:08:09] Finley: parker, your stalling feels dodgy—why haven’t you settled on one suspect
[17:08:11] Parker: i’m sticking with kennedy—her silence feels way more suspicious than sidney’s
[17:08:14] Kennedy: i’m voting parker unless he explains his flip-flopping right now
[17:08:15] Adrian: parker, why the sudden switch from sidney to kennedy
[17:08:33] Adrian: finley, what makes parker’s deflections more suspicious than kennedy’s silence
[17:08:38] Sidney: sidney: i’m voting parker for flip-flopping targets with zero evidence
[17:08:39] Drew: if we’re lynching sidney, what concrete evidence beyond silence do we have
[17:08:48] Tyler: drew, you kicked off this chat—who’s your top lynch choice
[17:08:53] Sidney: anyone else find parker’s eagerness to lynch kennedy without any solid proof way more alarming than kennedy’s quiet
[17:08:54] Parker: i won’t pick a suspect without solid evidence
[17:08:54] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:09:08] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker

[17:11:46] Drew: let’s each state one solid reason we suspect someone before casting our votes
[17:11:47] Sidney: voting tyler—too keen to defend finley
[17:11:52] Kennedy: drew, now that two innocents are down, who’s on your radar
[17:12:03] Kennedy: voting tyler—baseless defense of finley looks like a mafia diversion
[17:12:04] Tyler: finley, who’s your top suspect after last night’s kill
[17:12:08] Finley: tyler’s quick to echo my points—what’s your angle here
[17:12:12] Drew: any clue why mafia chose adrian last night
[17:12:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve asked for suspects but still haven’t named one yourself—who do you suspect
[17:12:28] Drew: i’m voting tyler because they’re just echoing finley’s claims without adding any evidence
[17:12:46] Sidney: they targeted adrian because his endless questions without naming a suspect reeked of classic mafia misdirection
[17:12:47] Tyler: i suspect sidney—her mirror-vote on me without any reasoning just doesn’t add up

## CONTENT: Your name is Drew.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:05:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Finley ( unknown ) 
 Tyler ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Sidney ( unknown ) 
Finley ( unknown ) 
Tyler ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[17:11:52] Kennedy: drew, now that two innocents are down, who’s on your radar

[17:12:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve asked for suspects but still haven’t named one yourself—who do you suspect
[17:12:28] Drew: i’m voting tyler because they’re just echoing finley’s claims without adding any evidence
[17:12:46] Sidney: they targeted adrian because his endless questions without naming a suspect reeked of classic mafia misdirection
[17:12:47] Tyler: i suspect sidney—her mirror-vote on me without any reasoning just doesn’t add up
[17:12:47] Drew: i’m suspecting kennedy for her quick vote to lynch tyler without offering solid reasoning
[17:12:49] Kennedy: adrian got killed for asking too many questions, so tyler’s defense of finley looks like misdirection
[17:12:52] Finley: i’m leaning drew—his push for solid reasons with no proof feels suspicious

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:05:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander )

The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[17:06:01] Drew: hello everyone, any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[17:06:05] Finley: morning all—does anyone have any early suspicions
[17:06:06] Parker: alright everyone, who’s our top suspect for this first lynch
[17:06:08] Tyler: hey everyone, any early gut feelings on who might be mafia
[17:06:08] Sidney: morning everyone, any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[17:06:11] Kennedy: parker, any early suspicions on who might be the mafia
[17:06:13] Adrian: day one—who’s on your suspect list so far
[17:06:16] Drew: anybody else think someone’s been oddly quiet so far
[17:06:21] Sidney: hey everyone, noticed kennedy’s been really quiet—innocent or suspicious
[17:06:21] Finley: tyler’s awfully quiet, anyone else find that odd
[17:06:22] Tyler: i’ve got my eye on sidney—they’ve been awfully quiet so far
[17:06:24] Parker: morning—sidney’s quietness feels suspicious so far, anyone else notice
[17:06:34] Finley: kennedy, you’ve been quiet—who do you suspect
[17:06:35] Tyler: i’ve been quiet, but kennedy’s radio silence after that one question feels way more suspicious
[17:06:37] Kennedy: tyler, any gut feeling on who we should lynch
[17:06:43] Sidney: kennedy’s awfully quiet after that one question—anyone else notice
[17:06:45] Drew: parker, who’s your top suspect for today’s lynch
[17:06:46] Parker: kennedy barely chimed in—should we be wary of that
[17:06:48] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, tyler hasn’t offered any guesses yet—does that strike anyone as odd
[17:06:52] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward sidney for our first vote—any objections
[17:06:56] Finley: parker jumping on sidney so quickly feels off—anyone else notice
[17:07:00] Tyler: adrian’s been asking a lot but never names anyone—feels suspicious
[17:07:00] Drew: tyler’s quick to blame sidney—anyone else find that odd
[17:07:10] Adrian: anyone think we’re targeting kennedy just for being quiet
[17:07:18] Sidney: tyler, why the sudden switch from me to kennedy
[17:07:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward kennedy—anyone else notice their silence feels off
[17:07:19] Drew: adrian’s been asking a lot but still hasn’t named a suspect—why
[17:07:20] Finley: i’m not convinced sidney is mafia—anyone else think parker’s deflections are odd
[17:07:22] Kennedy: kennedy: sidney’s been uncannily quiet—anyone else flag that
[17:07:23] Tyler: why is parker so eager to lynch sidney—what’s his angle
[17:07:29] Adrian: kennedy’s sudden vote for sidney after being silent this whole time feels off—anyone else agree
[17:07:32] Parker: sidney raises a solid point—tyler, why the abrupt switch to kennedy
[17:07:33] Drew: anyone else find adrian’s eagerness without naming a suspect odd
[17:07:34] Kennedy: adrian’s asking nonstop yet still names no suspect—why the deflection
[17:07:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve flip-flopped between sidney and kennedy—what’s your actual read
[17:07:52] Parker: adrian, why do you think kennedy’s vote for sidney is so sudden
[17:07:53] Tyler: i’m with finley—parker’s sudden deflections feel more suspicious than sidney’s quiet
[17:07:58] Kennedy: notice parker and tyler echoing each other’s accusations of sidney without any new evidence
[17:08:07] Sidney: adrian asking for suspects but never naming one himself seems odd—anyone else notice
[17:08:09] Finley: parker, your stalling feels dodgy—why haven’t you settled on one suspect
[17:08:11] Parker: i’m sticking with kennedy—her silence feels way more suspicious than sidney’s
[17:08:14] Kennedy: i’m voting parker unless he explains his flip-flopping right now
[17:08:15] Adrian: parker, why the sudden switch from sidney to kennedy
[17:08:33] Adrian: finley, what makes parker’s deflections more suspicious than kennedy’s silence
[17:08:38] Sidney: sidney: i’m voting parker for flip-flopping targets with zero evidence
[17:08:39] Drew: if we’re lynching sidney, what concrete evidence beyond silence do we have
[17:08:48] Tyler: drew, you kicked off this chat—who’s your top lynch choice
[17:08:53] Sidney: anyone else find parker’s eagerness to lynch kennedy without any solid proof way more alarming than kennedy’s quiet
[17:08:54] Parker: i won’t pick a suspect without solid evidence
[17:08:54] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.

[17:11:21] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:11:46] Drew: let’s each state one solid reason we suspect someone before casting our votes
[17:11:47] Sidney: voting tyler—too keen to defend finley
[17:11:52] Kennedy: drew, now that two innocents are down, who’s on your radar
[17:12:03] Kennedy: voting tyler—baseless defense of finley looks like a mafia diversion
[17:12:04] Tyler: finley, who’s your top suspect after last night’s kill
[17:12:08] Finley: tyler’s quick to echo my points—what’s your angle here
[17:12:12] Drew: any clue why mafia chose adrian last night
[17:12:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve asked for suspects but still haven’t named one yourself—who do you suspect
[17:12:28] Drew: i’m voting tyler because they’re just echoing finley’s claims without adding any evidence
[17:12:46] Sidney: they targeted adrian because his endless questions without naming a suspect reeked of classic mafia misdirection
[17:12:47] Tyler: i suspect sidney—her mirror-vote on me without any reasoning just doesn’t add up
[17:12:47] Drew: i’m suspecting kennedy for her quick vote to lynch tyler without offering solid reasoning
[17:12:49] Kennedy: adrian got killed for asking too many questions, so tyler’s defense of finley looks like misdirection
[17:12:52] Finley: i’m leaning drew—his push for solid reasons with no proof feels suspicious
Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status.

## CONTENT: Your name is Drew.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:05:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Finley ( unknown ) 
 Tyler ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Sidney ( unknown ) 
Finley ( unknown ) 
Tyler ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[17:06:52] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward sidney for our first vote—any objections
[17:06:56] Finley: parker jumping on sidney so quickly feels off—anyone else notice
[17:07:00] Tyler: adrian’s been asking a lot but never names anyone—feels suspicious
[17:07:00] Drew: tyler’s quick to blame sidney—anyone else find that odd
[17:07:10] Adrian: anyone think we’re targeting kennedy just for being quiet
[17:07:18] Sidney: tyler, why the sudden switch from me to kennedy
[17:07:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward kennedy—anyone else notice their silence feels off
[17:07:19] Drew: adrian’s been asking a lot but still hasn’t named a suspect—why
[17:07:20] Finley: i’m not convinced sidney is mafia—anyone else think parker’s deflections are odd
[17:07:22] Kennedy: kennedy: sidney’s been uncannily quiet—anyone else flag that
[17:07:23] Tyler: why is parker so eager to lynch sidney—what’s his angle
[17:07:29] Adrian: kennedy’s sudden vote for sidney after being silent this whole time feels off—anyone else agree
[17:07:32] Parker: sidney raises a solid point—tyler, why the abrupt switch to kennedy
[17:07:33] Drew: anyone else find adrian’s eagerness without naming a suspect odd
[17:07:34] Kennedy: adrian’s asking nonstop yet still names no suspect—why the deflection
[17:07:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve flip-flopped between sidney and kennedy—what’s your actual read
[17:07:52] Parker: adrian, why do you think kennedy’s vote for sidney is so sudden
[17:07:53] Tyler: i’m with finley—parker’s sudden deflections feel more suspicious than sidney’s quiet
[17:07:58] Kennedy: notice parker and tyler echoing each other’s accusations of sidney without any new evidence
[17:08:07] Sidney: adrian asking for suspects but never naming one himself seems odd—anyone else notice
[17:08:09] Finley: parker, your stalling feels dodgy—why haven’t you settled on one suspect
[17:08:11] Parker: i’m sticking with kennedy—her silence feels way more suspicious than sidney’s
[17:08:14] Kennedy: i’m voting parker unless he explains his flip-flopping right now
[17:08:15] Adrian: parker, why the sudden switch from sidney to kennedy
[17:08:33] Adrian: finley, what makes parker’s deflections more suspicious than kennedy’s silence
[17:08:38] Sidney: sidney: i’m voting parker for flip-flopping targets with zero evidence
[17:08:39] Drew: if we’re lynching sidney, what concrete evidence beyond silence do we have
[17:08:48] Tyler: drew, you kicked off this chat—who’s your top lynch choice
[17:08:53] Sidney: anyone else find parker’s eagerness to lynch kennedy without any solid proof way more alarming than kennedy’s quiet
[17:08:54] Parker: i won’t pick a suspect without solid evidence
[17:08:54] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:09:08] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:09:17] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[17:09:18] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Adrian
[17:09:18] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Kennedy
[17:09:22] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:09:41] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[17:11:21] Game-Manager: Adrian was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[17:11:21] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:11:46] Drew: let’s each state one solid reason we suspect someone before casting our votes
[17:11:47] Sidney: voting tyler—too keen to defend finley
[17:11:52] Kennedy: drew, now that two innocents are down, who’s on your radar
[17:12:03] Kennedy: voting tyler—baseless defense of finley looks like a mafia diversion
[17:12:04] Tyler: finley, who’s your top suspect after last night’s kill
[17:12:08] Finley: tyler’s quick to echo my points—what’s your angle here
[17:12:12] Drew: any clue why mafia chose adrian last night
[17:12:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve asked for suspects but still haven’t named one yourself—who do you suspect
[17:12:28] Drew: i’m voting tyler because they’re just echoing finley’s claims without adding any evidence
[17:12:46] Sidney: they targeted adrian because his endless questions without naming a suspect reeked of classic mafia misdirection
[17:12:47] Tyler: i suspect sidney—her mirror-vote on me without any reasoning just doesn’t add up
[17:12:47] Drew: i’m suspecting kennedy for her quick vote to lynch tyler without offering solid reasoning
[17:12:49] Kennedy: adrian got killed for asking too many questions, so tyler’s defense of finley looks like misdirection
[17:12:52] Finley: i’m leaning drew—his push for solid reasons with no proof feels suspicious
[17:13:18] Kennedy: i’m voting tyler because parroting finley instead of offering his own reasoning reeks of mafia coordination
[17:13:18] Tyler: sidney, do you really think my questions helped the mafia kill adrian
[17:13:34] Finley: tyler’s shift from silence to defending me reads like deflection

## OPERATION: Complete Prompt to LLM
## CONTENT: Your name is Drew.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:05:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Finley ( unknown ) 
 Tyler ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Sidney ( unknown ) 
Finley ( unknown ) 
Tyler ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[17:12:28] Drew: i’m voting tyler because they’re just echoing finley’s claims without adding any evidence
[17:12:46] Sidney: they targeted adrian because his endless questions without naming a suspect reeked of classic mafia misdirection
[17:12:47] Tyler: i suspect sidney—her mirror-vote on me without any reasoning just doesn’t add up
[17:12:47] Drew: i’m suspecting kennedy for her quick vote to lynch tyler without offering solid reasoning
[17:12:49] Kennedy: adrian got killed for asking too many questions, so tyler’s defense of finley looks like misdirection
[17:12:52] Finley: i’m leaning drew—his push for solid reasons with no proof feels suspicious
[17:13:18] Kennedy: i’m voting tyler because parroting finley instead of offering his own reasoning reeks of mafia coordination
[17:13:18] Tyler: sidney, do you really think my questions helped the mafia kill adrian
[17:13:34] Finley: tyler’s shift from silence to defending me reads like deflection
[17:13:36] Drew: finley’s accusing me without offering any evidence themselves

[17:05:54] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:06:01] Drew: hello everyone, any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[17:06:05] Finley: morning all—does anyone have any early suspicions
[17:06:06] Parker: alright everyone, who’s our top suspect for this first lynch
[17:06:08] Tyler: hey everyone, any early gut feelings on who might be mafia
[17:06:08] Sidney: morning everyone, any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[17:06:11] Kennedy: parker, any early suspicions on who might be the mafia
[17:06:13] Adrian: day one—who’s on your suspect list so far
[17:06:16] Drew: anybody else think someone’s been oddly quiet so far
[17:06:21] Sidney: hey everyone, noticed kennedy’s been really quiet—innocent or suspicious
[17:06:21] Finley: tyler’s awfully quiet, anyone else find that odd
[17:06:22] Tyler: i’ve got my eye on sidney—they’ve been awfully quiet so far
[17:06:24] Parker: morning—sidney’s quietness feels suspicious so far, anyone else notice
[17:06:34] Finley: kennedy, you’ve been quiet—who do you suspect
[17:06:35] Tyler: i’ve been quiet, but kennedy’s radio silence after that one question feels way more suspicious
[17:06:37] Kennedy: tyler, any gut feeling on who we should lynch
[17:06:43] Sidney: kennedy’s awfully quiet after that one question—anyone else notice
[17:06:45] Drew: parker, who’s your top suspect for today’s lynch
[17:06:46] Parker: kennedy barely chimed in—should we be wary of that
[17:06:48] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, tyler hasn’t offered any guesses yet—does that strike anyone as odd
[17:06:52] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward sidney for our first vote—any objections
[17:06:56] Finley: parker jumping on sidney so quickly feels off—anyone else notice
[17:07:00] Tyler: adrian’s been asking a lot but never names anyone—feels suspicious
[17:07:00] Drew: tyler’s quick to blame sidney—anyone else find that odd
[17:07:10] Adrian: anyone think we’re targeting kennedy just for being quiet
[17:07:18] Sidney: tyler, why the sudden switch from me to kennedy
[17:07:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward kennedy—anyone else notice their silence feels off
[17:07:19] Drew: adrian’s been asking a lot but still hasn’t named a suspect—why
[17:07:20] Finley: i’m not convinced sidney is mafia—anyone else think parker’s deflections are odd
[17:07:22] Kennedy: kennedy: sidney’s been uncannily quiet—anyone else flag that
[17:07:23] Tyler: why is parker so eager to lynch sidney—what’s his angle
[17:07:29] Adrian: kennedy’s sudden vote for sidney after being silent this whole time feels off—anyone else agree
[17:07:32] Parker: sidney raises a solid point—tyler, why the abrupt switch to kennedy
[17:07:33] Drew: anyone else find adrian’s eagerness without naming a suspect odd
[17:07:34] Kennedy: adrian’s asking nonstop yet still names no suspect—why the deflection
[17:07:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve flip-flopped between sidney and kennedy—what’s your actual read
[17:07:52] Parker: adrian, why do you think kennedy’s vote for sidney is so sudden
[17:07:53] Tyler: i’m with finley—parker’s sudden deflections feel more suspicious than sidney’s quiet
[17:07:58] Kennedy: notice parker and tyler echoing each other’s accusations of sidney without any new evidence
[17:08:07] Sidney: adrian asking for suspects but never naming one himself seems odd—anyone else notice
[17:08:09] Finley: parker, your stalling feels dodgy—why haven’t you settled on one suspect
[17:08:11] Parker: i’m sticking with kennedy—her silence feels way more suspicious than sidney’s
[17:08:14] Kennedy: i’m voting parker unless he explains his flip-flopping right now
[17:08:15] Adrian: parker, why the sudden switch from sidney to kennedy
[17:08:33] Adrian: finley, what makes parker’s deflections more suspicious than kennedy’s silence
[17:08:38] Sidney: sidney: i’m voting parker for flip-flopping targets with zero evidence
[17:08:39] Drew: if we’re lynching sidney, what concrete evidence beyond silence do we have
[17:08:48] Tyler: drew, you kicked off this chat—who’s your top lynch choice
[17:08:53] Sidney: anyone else find parker’s eagerness to lynch kennedy without any solid proof way more alarming than kennedy’s quiet
[17:08:54] Parker: i won’t pick a suspect without solid evidence
[17:08:54] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.

[17:11:47] Sidney: voting tyler—too keen to defend finley
[17:11:52] Kennedy: drew, now that two innocents are down, who’s on your radar
[17:12:03] Kennedy: voting tyler—baseless defense of finley looks like a mafia diversion

## CONTENT: Your name is Drew.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:05:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Finley ( unknown ) 
 Tyler ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Sidney ( unknown ) 
Finley ( unknown ) 
Tyler ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[17:06:21] Finley: tyler’s awfully quiet, anyone else find that odd
[17:06:22] Tyler: i’ve got my eye on sidney—they’ve been awfully quiet so far
[17:06:24] Parker: morning—sidney’s quietness feels suspicious so far, anyone else notice
[17:06:34] Finley: kennedy, you’ve been quiet—who do you suspect
[17:06:35] Tyler: i’ve been quiet, but kennedy’s radio silence after that one question feels way more suspicious
[17:06:37] Kennedy: tyler, any gut feeling on who we should lynch
[17:06:43] Sidney: kennedy’s awfully quiet after that one question—anyone else notice
[17:06:45] Drew: parker, who’s your top suspect for today’s lynch
[17:06:46] Parker: kennedy barely chimed in—should we be wary of that
[17:06:48] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, tyler hasn’t offered any guesses yet—does that strike anyone as odd
[17:06:52] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward sidney for our first vote—any objections
[17:06:56] Finley: parker jumping on sidney so quickly feels off—anyone else notice
[17:07:00] Tyler: adrian’s been asking a lot but never names anyone—feels suspicious
[17:07:00] Drew: tyler’s quick to blame sidney—anyone else find that odd
[17:07:10] Adrian: anyone think we’re targeting kennedy just for being quiet
[17:07:18] Sidney: tyler, why the sudden switch from me to kennedy
[17:07:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward kennedy—anyone else notice their silence feels off
[17:07:19] Drew: adrian’s been asking a lot but still hasn’t named a suspect—why
[17:07:20] Finley: i’m not convinced sidney is mafia—anyone else think parker’s deflections are odd
[17:07:22] Kennedy: kennedy: sidney’s been uncannily quiet—anyone else flag that
[17:07:23] Tyler: why is parker so eager to lynch sidney—what’s his angle
[17:07:29] Adrian: kennedy’s sudden vote for sidney after being silent this whole time feels off—anyone else agree
[17:07:32] Parker: sidney raises a solid point—tyler, why the abrupt switch to kennedy
[17:07:33] Drew: anyone else find adrian’s eagerness without naming a suspect odd

[17:07:53] Tyler: i’m with finley—parker’s sudden deflections feel more suspicious than sidney’s quiet
[17:07:58] Kennedy: notice parker and tyler echoing each other’s accusations of sidney without any new evidence
[17:08:07] Sidney: adrian asking for suspects but never naming one himself seems odd—anyone else notice
[17:08:09] Finley: parker, your stalling feels dodgy—why haven’t you settled on one suspect
[17:08:11] Parker: i’m sticking with kennedy—her silence feels way more suspicious than sidney’s
[17:08:14] Kennedy: i’m voting parker unless he explains his flip-flopping right now
[17:08:15] Adrian: parker, why the sudden switch from sidney to kennedy
[17:08:33] Adrian: finley, what makes parker’s deflections more suspicious than kennedy’s silence
[17:08:38] Sidney: sidney: i’m voting parker for flip-flopping targets with zero evidence
[17:08:39] Drew: if we’re lynching sidney, what concrete evidence beyond silence do we have
[17:08:48] Tyler: drew, you kicked off this chat—who’s your top lynch choice
[17:08:53] Sidney: anyone else find parker’s eagerness to lynch kennedy without any solid proof way more alarming than kennedy’s quiet
[17:08:54] Parker: i won’t pick a suspect without solid evidence
[17:08:54] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:09:08] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:09:17] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[17:09:18] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Adrian
[17:09:18] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Kennedy

[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[17:11:21] Game-Manager: Adrian was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[17:11:21] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:11:46] Drew: let’s each state one solid reason we suspect someone before casting our votes
[17:11:47] Sidney: voting tyler—too keen to defend finley
[17:11:52] Kennedy: drew, now that two innocents are down, who’s on your radar
[17:12:03] Kennedy: voting tyler—baseless defense of finley looks like a mafia diversion
[17:12:04] Tyler: finley, who’s your top suspect after last night’s kill
[17:12:08] Finley: tyler’s quick to echo my points—what’s your angle here
[17:12:12] Drew: any clue why mafia chose adrian last night
[17:12:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve asked for suspects but still haven’t named one yourself—who do you suspect
[17:12:28] Drew: i’m voting tyler because they’re just echoing finley’s claims without adding any evidence
[17:12:46] Sidney: they targeted adrian because his endless questions without naming a suspect reeked of classic mafia misdirection
[17:12:47] Tyler: i suspect sidney—her mirror-vote on me without any reasoning just doesn’t add up
[17:12:47] Drew: i’m suspecting kennedy for her quick vote to lynch tyler without offering solid reasoning
[17:12:49] Kennedy: adrian got killed for asking too many questions, so tyler’s defense of finley looks like misdirection
[17:12:52] Finley: i’m leaning drew—his push for solid reasons with no proof feels suspicious
[17:13:18] Kennedy: i’m voting tyler because parroting finley instead of offering his own reasoning reeks of mafia coordination
[17:13:18] Tyler: sidney, do you really think my questions helped the mafia kill adrian
[17:13:34] Finley: tyler’s shift from silence to defending me reads like deflection
[17:13:36] Drew: finley’s accusing me without offering any evidence themselves
[17:13:50] Tyler: voting drew—demanding proof while providing none himself screams mafia misdirection

## CONTENT: Your name is Drew.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:05:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Finley ( unknown ) 
 Tyler ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Sidney ( unknown ) 
Finley ( unknown ) 
Tyler ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[17:07:52] Parker: adrian, why do you think kennedy’s vote for sidney is so sudden
[17:07:53] Tyler: i’m with finley—parker’s sudden deflections feel more suspicious than sidney’s quiet

[17:08:54] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:09:08] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:09:17] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[17:09:18] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Adrian
[17:09:18] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Kennedy

[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[17:11:21] Game-Manager: Adrian was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[17:11:21] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:11:46] Drew: let’s each state one solid reason we suspect someone before casting our votes
[17:11:47] Sidney: voting tyler—too keen to defend finley
[17:11:52] Kennedy: drew, now that two innocents are down, who’s on your radar
[17:12:03] Kennedy: voting tyler—baseless defense of finley looks like a mafia diversion
[17:12:04] Tyler: finley, who’s your top suspect after last night’s kill
[17:12:08] Finley: tyler’s quick to echo my points—what’s your angle here
[17:12:12] Drew: any clue why mafia chose adrian last night
[17:12:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve asked for suspects but still haven’t named one yourself—who do you suspect
[17:12:28] Drew: i’m voting tyler because they’re just echoing finley’s claims without adding any evidence
[17:12:46] Sidney: they targeted adrian because his endless questions without naming a suspect reeked of classic mafia misdirection
[17:12:47] Tyler: i suspect sidney—her mirror-vote on me without any reasoning just doesn’t add up
[17:12:47] Drew: i’m suspecting kennedy for her quick vote to lynch tyler without offering solid reasoning
[17:12:49] Kennedy: adrian got killed for asking too many questions, so tyler’s defense of finley looks like misdirection
[17:12:52] Finley: i’m leaning drew—his push for solid reasons with no proof feels suspicious
[17:13:18] Kennedy: i’m voting tyler because parroting finley instead of offering his own reasoning reeks of mafia coordination
[17:13:18] Tyler: sidney, do you really think my questions helped the mafia kill adrian
[17:13:34] Finley: tyler’s shift from silence to defending me reads like deflection
[17:13:36] Drew: finley’s accusing me without offering any evidence themselves
[17:13:50] Tyler: voting drew—demanding proof while providing none himself screams mafia misdirection

## CONTENT: Your name is Drew.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:05:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Finley ( unknown ) 
 Tyler ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Sidney ( unknown ) 
Finley ( unknown ) 
Tyler ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown )

<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

## CONTENT: Your name is Drew.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:05:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Finley ( unknown ) 
 Tyler ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:05:54] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:06:01] Drew: hello everyone, any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[17:06:05] Finley: morning all—does anyone have any early suspicions
[17:06:06] Parker: alright everyone, who’s our top suspect for this first lynch
[17:06:08] Tyler: hey everyone, any early gut feelings on who might be mafia
[17:06:08] Sidney: morning everyone, any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[17:06:11] Kennedy: parker, any early suspicions on who might be the mafia
[17:06:13] Adrian: day one—who’s on your suspect list so far
[17:06:16] Drew: anybody else think someone’s been oddly quiet so far
[17:06:21] Sidney: hey everyone, noticed kennedy’s been really quiet—innocent or suspicious
[17:06:21] Finley: tyler’s awfully quiet, anyone else find that odd
[17:06:22] Tyler: i’ve got my eye on sidney—they’ve been awfully quiet so far
[17:06:24] Parker: morning—sidney’s quietness feels suspicious so far, anyone else notice
[17:06:34] Finley: kennedy, you’ve been quiet—who do you suspect
[17:06:35] Tyler: i’ve been quiet, but kennedy’s radio silence after that one question feels way more suspicious
[17:06:37] Kennedy: tyler, any gut feeling on who we should lynch
[17:06:43] Sidney: kennedy’s awfully quiet after that one question—anyone else notice
[17:06:45] Drew: parker, who’s your top suspect for today’s lynch
[17:06:46] Parker: kennedy barely chimed in—should we be wary of that
[17:06:48] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, tyler hasn’t offered any guesses yet—does that strike anyone as odd
[17:06:52] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward sidney for our first vote—any objections
[17:06:56] Finley: parker jumping on sidney so quickly feels off—anyone else notice
[17:07:00] Tyler: adrian’s been asking a lot but never names anyone—feels suspicious
[17:07:00] Drew: tyler’s quick to blame sidney—anyone else find that odd
[17:07:10] Adrian: anyone think we’re targeting kennedy just for being quiet
[17:07:18] Sidney: tyler, why the sudden switch from me to kennedy
[17:07:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward kennedy—anyone else notice their silence feels off
[17:07:19] Drew: adrian’s been asking a lot but still hasn’t named a suspect—why
[17:07:20] Finley: i’m not convinced sidney is mafia—anyone else think parker’s deflections are odd
[17:07:22] Kennedy: kennedy: sidney’s been uncannily quiet—anyone else flag that
[17:07:23] Tyler: why is parker so eager to lynch sidney—what’s his angle
[17:07:29] Adrian: kennedy’s sudden vote for sidney after being silent this whole time feels off—anyone else agree
[17:07:32] Parker: sidney raises a solid point—tyler, why the abrupt switch to kennedy
[17:07:33] Drew: anyone else find adrian’s eagerness without naming a suspect odd
[17:07:34] Kennedy: adrian’s asking nonstop yet still names no suspect—why the deflection
[17:07:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve flip-flopped between sidney and kennedy—what’s your actual read
[17:07:52] Parker: adrian, why do you think kennedy’s vote for sidney is so sudden
[17:07:53] Tyler: i’m with finley—parker’s sudden deflections feel more suspicious than sidney’s quiet
[17:07:58] Kennedy: notice parker and tyler echoing each other’s accusations of sidney without any new evidence
[17:08:07] Sidney: adrian asking for suspects but never naming one himself seems odd—anyone else notice
[17:08:09] Finley: parker, your stalling feels dodgy—why haven’t you settled on one suspect
[17:08:11] Parker: i’m sticking with kennedy—her silence feels way more suspicious than sidney’s
[17:08:14] Kennedy: i’m voting parker unless he explains his flip-flopping right now
[17:08:15] Adrian: parker, why the sudden switch from sidney to kennedy
[17:08:33] Adrian: finley, what makes parker’s deflections more suspicious than kennedy’s silence
[17:08:38] Sidney: sidney: i’m voting parker for flip-flopping targets with zero evidence
[17:08:39] Drew: if we’re lynching sidney, what concrete evidence beyond silence do we have
[17:08:48] Tyler: drew, you kicked off this chat—who’s your top lynch choice
[17:08:53] Sidney: anyone else find parker’s eagerness to lynch kennedy without any solid proof way more alarming than kennedy’s quiet
[17:08:54] Parker: i won’t pick a suspect without solid evidence
[17:08:54] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:09:08] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:09:17] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[17:09:18] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Adrian

[17:11:21] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:11:46] Drew: let’s each state one solid reason we suspect someone before casting our votes
[17:11:47] Sidney: voting tyler—too keen to defend finley
[17:11:52] Kennedy: drew, now that two innocents are down, who’s on your radar
[17:12:03] Kennedy: voting tyler—baseless defense of finley looks like a mafia diversion
[17:12:04] Tyler: finley, who’s your top suspect after last night’s kill
[17:12:08] Finley: tyler’s quick to echo my points—what’s your angle here
[17:12:12] Drew: any clue why mafia chose adrian last night
[17:12:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve asked for suspects but still haven’t named one yourself—who do you suspect
[17:12:28] Drew: i’m voting tyler because they’re just echoing finley’s claims without adding any evidence
[17:12:46] Sidney: they targeted adrian because his endless questions without naming a suspect reeked of classic mafia misdirection
[17:12:47] Tyler: i suspect sidney—her mirror-vote on me without any reasoning just doesn’t add up
[17:12:47] Drew: i’m suspecting kennedy for her quick vote to lynch tyler without offering solid reasoning
[17:12:49] Kennedy: adrian got killed for asking too many questions, so tyler’s defense of finley looks like misdirection

[17:13:36] Drew: finley’s accusing me without offering any evidence themselves
[17:13:50] Tyler: voting drew—demanding proof while providing none himself screams mafia misdirection

[17:06:01] Drew: hello everyone, any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[17:06:05] Finley: morning all—does anyone have any early suspicions
[17:06:06] Parker: alright everyone, who’s our top suspect for this first lynch
[17:06:08] Tyler: hey everyone, any early gut feelings on who might be mafia
[17:06:08] Sidney: morning everyone, any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[17:06:11] Kennedy: parker, any early suspicions on who might be the mafia
[17:06:13] Adrian: day one—who’s on your suspect list so far
[17:06:16] Drew: anybody else think someone’s been oddly quiet so far
[17:06:21] Sidney: hey everyone, noticed kennedy’s been really quiet—innocent or suspicious
[17:06:21] Finley: tyler’s awfully quiet, anyone else find that odd
[17:06:22] Tyler: i’ve got my eye on sidney—they’ve been awfully quiet so far
[17:06:24] Parker: morning—sidney’s quietness feels suspicious so far, anyone else notice
[17:06:34] Finley: kennedy, you’ve been quiet—who do you suspect
[17:06:35] Tyler: i’ve been quiet, but kennedy’s radio silence after that one question feels way more suspicious
[17:06:37] Kennedy: tyler, any gut feeling on who we should lynch
[17:06:43] Sidney: kennedy’s awfully quiet after that one question—anyone else notice
[17:06:45] Drew: parker, who’s your top suspect for today’s lynch
[17:06:46] Parker: kennedy barely chimed in—should we be wary of that
[17:06:48] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, tyler hasn’t offered any guesses yet—does that strike anyone as odd
[17:06:52] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward sidney for our first vote—any objections
[17:06:56] Finley: parker jumping on sidney so quickly feels off—anyone else notice
[17:07:00] Tyler: adrian’s been asking a lot but never names anyone—feels suspicious
[17:07:00] Drew: tyler’s quick to blame sidney—anyone else find that odd
[17:07:10] Adrian: anyone think we’re targeting kennedy just for being quiet
[17:07:18] Sidney: tyler, why the sudden switch from me to kennedy
[17:07:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward kennedy—anyone else notice their silence feels off
[17:07:19] Drew: adrian’s been asking a lot but still hasn’t named a suspect—why
[17:07:20] Finley: i’m not convinced sidney is mafia—anyone else think parker’s deflections are odd
[17:07:22] Kennedy: kennedy: sidney’s been uncannily quiet—anyone else flag that
[17:07:23] Tyler: why is parker so eager to lynch sidney—what’s his angle
[17:07:29] Adrian: kennedy’s sudden vote for sidney after being silent this whole time feels off—anyone else agree
[17:07:32] Parker: sidney raises a solid point—tyler, why the abrupt switch to kennedy
[17:07:33] Drew: anyone else find adrian’s eagerness without naming a suspect odd
[17:07:34] Kennedy: adrian’s asking nonstop yet still names no suspect—why the deflection
[17:07:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve flip-flopped between sidney and kennedy—what’s your actual read
[17:07:52] Parker: adrian, why do you think kennedy’s vote for sidney is so sudden
[17:07:53] Tyler: i’m with finley—parker’s sudden deflections feel more suspicious than sidney’s quiet
[17:07:58] Kennedy: notice parker and tyler echoing each other’s accusations of sidney without any new evidence
[17:08:07] Sidney: adrian asking for suspects but never naming one himself seems odd—anyone else notice
[17:08:09] Finley: parker, your stalling feels dodgy—why haven’t you settled on one suspect
[17:08:11] Parker: i’m sticking with kennedy—her silence feels way more suspicious than sidney’s
[17:08:14] Kennedy: i’m voting parker unless he explains his flip-flopping right now
[17:08:15] Adrian: parker, why the sudden switch from sidney to kennedy
[17:08:33] Adrian: finley, what makes parker’s deflections more suspicious than kennedy’s silence
[17:08:38] Sidney: sidney: i’m voting parker for flip-flopping targets with zero evidence
[17:08:39] Drew: if we’re lynching sidney, what concrete evidence beyond silence do we have
[17:08:48] Tyler: drew, you kicked off this chat—who’s your top lynch choice
[17:08:53] Sidney: anyone else find parker’s eagerness to lynch kennedy without any solid proof way more alarming than kennedy’s quiet
[17:08:54] Parker: i won’t pick a suspect without solid evidence
[17:08:54] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:09:08] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:09:17] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[17:09:18] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Adrian
[17:09:18] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Kennedy
[17:09:22] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:09:41] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[17:11:21] Game-Manager: Adrian was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[17:11:21] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:11:46] Drew: let’s each state one solid reason we suspect someone before casting our votes
[17:11:47] Sidney: voting tyler—too keen to defend finley
[17:11:52] Kennedy: drew, now that two innocents are down, who’s on your radar
[17:12:03] Kennedy: voting tyler—baseless defense of finley looks like a mafia diversion
[17:12:04] Tyler: finley, who’s your top suspect after last night’s kill
[17:12:08] Finley: tyler’s quick to echo my points—what’s your angle here
[17:12:12] Drew: any clue why mafia chose adrian last night
[17:12:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve asked for suspects but still haven’t named one yourself—who do you suspect
[17:12:28] Drew: i’m voting tyler because they’re just echoing finley’s claims without adding any evidence
[17:12:46] Sidney: they targeted adrian because his endless questions without naming a suspect reeked of classic mafia misdirection
[17:12:47] Tyler: i suspect sidney—her mirror-vote on me without any reasoning just doesn’t add up
[17:12:47] Drew: i’m suspecting kennedy for her quick vote to lynch tyler without offering solid reasoning
[17:12:49] Kennedy: adrian got killed for asking too many questions, so tyler’s defense of finley looks like misdirection
[17:12:52] Finley: i’m leaning drew—his push for solid reasons with no proof feels suspicious
[17:13:18] Kennedy: i’m voting tyler because parroting finley instead of offering his own reasoning reeks of mafia coordination
[17:13:18] Tyler: sidney, do you really think my questions helped the mafia kill adrian
[17:13:34] Finley: tyler’s shift from silence to defending me reads like deflection
[17:13:36] Drew: finley’s accusing me without offering any evidence themselves
[17:13:50] Tyler: voting drew—demanding proof while providing none himself screams mafia misdirection
[17:14:15] Tyler: kennedy, you keep voting me with no fresh evidence—what’s your reasoning
[17:14:16] Sidney: rather than deflect onto me, tyler, how do you account for the three votes stacked against you
[17:14:18] Finley: voting tyler—his echo-chamber replies feel entirely manufactured
[17:14:21] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

## CONTENT: Your name is Drew.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:05:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Finley ( unknown ) 
 Tyler ( bystander ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Sidney ( unknown ) 
Finley ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[17:08:33] Adrian: finley, what makes parker’s deflections more suspicious than kennedy’s silence
[17:08:38] Sidney: sidney: i’m voting parker for flip-flopping targets with zero evidence
[17:08:39] Drew: if we’re lynching sidney, what concrete evidence beyond silence do we have
[17:08:48] Tyler: drew, you kicked off this chat—who’s your top lynch choice
[17:08:53] Sidney: anyone else find parker’s eagerness to lynch kennedy without any solid proof way more alarming than kennedy’s quiet
[17:08:54] Parker: i won’t pick a suspect without solid evidence
[17:08:54] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:09:08] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:09:17] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[17:09:18] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Adrian
[17:09:18] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Kennedy
[17:09:22] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:09:41] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[17:11:21] Game-Manager: Adrian was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[17:11:21] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:11:46] Drew: let’s each state one solid reason we suspect someone before casting our votes
[17:11:47] Sidney: voting tyler—too keen to defend finley
[17:11:52] Kennedy: drew, now that two innocents are down, who’s on your radar
[17:12:03] Kennedy: voting tyler—baseless defense of finley looks like a mafia diversion
[17:12:04] Tyler: finley, who’s your top suspect after last night’s kill
[17:12:08] Finley: tyler’s quick to echo my points—what’s your angle here
[17:12:12] Drew: any clue why mafia chose adrian last night
[17:12:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve asked for suspects but still haven’t named one yourself—who do you suspect
[17:12:28] Drew: i’m voting tyler because they’re just echoing finley’s claims without adding any evidence
[17:12:46] Sidney: they targeted adrian because his endless questions without naming a suspect reeked of classic mafia misdirection
[17:12:47] Tyler: i suspect sidney—her mirror-vote on me without any reasoning just doesn’t add up
[17:12:47] Drew: i’m suspecting kennedy for her quick vote to lynch tyler without offering solid reasoning
[17:12:49] Kennedy: adrian got killed for asking too many questions, so tyler’s defense of finley looks like misdirection
[17:12:52] Finley: i’m leaning drew—his push for solid reasons with no proof feels suspicious
[17:13:18] Kennedy: i’m voting tyler because parroting finley instead of offering his own reasoning reeks of mafia coordination
[17:13:18] Tyler: sidney, do you really think my questions helped the mafia kill adrian
[17:13:34] Finley: tyler’s shift from silence to defending me reads like deflection
[17:13:36] Drew: finley’s accusing me without offering any evidence themselves
[17:13:50] Tyler: voting drew—demanding proof while providing none himself screams mafia misdirection
[17:14:15] Tyler: kennedy, you keep voting me with no fresh evidence—what’s your reasoning
[17:14:16] Sidney: rather than deflect onto me, tyler, how do you account for the three votes stacked against you
[17:14:18] Finley: voting tyler—his echo-chamber replies feel entirely manufactured
[17:14:21] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
