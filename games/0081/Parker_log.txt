## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. +

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[17:06:34] Finley: kennedy, you’ve been quiet—who do you suspect
[17:06:35] Tyler: i’ve been quiet, but kennedy’s radio silence after that one question feels way more suspicious
[17:06:37] Kennedy: tyler, any gut feeling on who we should lynch
[17:06:43] Sidney: kennedy’s awfully quiet after that one question—anyone else notice
[17:06:45] Drew: parker, who’s your top suspect for today’s lynch

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[17:06:35] Tyler: i’ve been quiet, but kennedy’s radio silence after that one question feels way more suspicious
[17:06:37] Kennedy: tyler, any gut feeling on who we should lynch
[17:06:43] Sidney: kennedy’s awfully quiet after that one question—anyone else notice

[17:06:21] Finley: tyler’s awfully quiet, anyone else find that odd
[17:06:22] Tyler: i’ve got my eye on sidney—they’ve been awfully quiet so far
[17:06:24] Parker: morning—sidney’s quietness feels suspicious so far, anyone else notice
[17:06:34] Finley: kennedy, you’ve been quiet—who do you suspect
[17:06:35] Tyler: i’ve been quiet, but kennedy’s radio silence after that one question feels way more suspicious
[17:06:37] Kennedy: tyler, any gut feeling on who we should lynch
[17:06:43] Sidney: kennedy’s awfully quiet after that one question—anyone else notice
[17:06:45] Drew: parker, who’s your top suspect for today’s lynch
[17:06:46] Parker: kennedy barely chimed in—should we be wary of that
[17:06:48] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, tyler hasn’t offered any guesses yet—does that strike anyone as odd
[17:06:52] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward sidney for our first vote—any objections
[17:06:56] Finley: parker jumping on sidney so quickly feels off—anyone else notice
[17:07:00] Tyler: adrian’s been asking a lot but never names anyone—feels suspicious
[17:07:00] Drew: tyler’s quick to blame sidney—anyone else find that odd
[17:07:10] Adrian: anyone think we’re targeting kennedy just for being quiet
[17:07:18] Sidney: tyler, why the sudden switch from me to kennedy
[17:07:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward kennedy—anyone else notice their silence feels off
[17:07:19] Drew: adrian’s been asking a lot but still hasn’t named a suspect—why
[17:07:20] Finley: i’m not convinced sidney is mafia—anyone else think parker’s deflections are odd
[17:07:22] Kennedy: kennedy: sidney’s been uncannily quiet—anyone else flag that
[17:07:23] Tyler: why is parker so eager to lynch sidney—what’s his angle
[17:07:29] Adrian: kennedy’s sudden vote for sidney after being silent this whole time feels off—anyone else agree
[17:07:32] Parker: sidney raises a solid point—tyler, why the abrupt switch to kennedy
[17:07:33] Drew: anyone else find adrian’s eagerness without naming a suspect odd
[17:07:34] Kennedy: adrian’s asking nonstop yet still names no suspect—why the deflection
[17:07:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve flip-flopped between sidney and kennedy—what’s your actual read
[17:07:52] Parker: adrian, why do you think kennedy’s vote for sidney is so sudden
[17:07:53] Tyler: i’m with finley—parker’s sudden deflections feel more suspicious than sidney’s quiet
[17:07:58] Kennedy: notice parker and tyler echoing each other’s accusations of sidney without any new evidence
[17:08:07] Sidney: adrian asking for suspects but never naming one himself seems odd—anyone else notice
[17:08:09] Finley: parker, your stalling feels dodgy—why haven’t you settled on one suspect
[17:08:11] Parker: i’m sticking with kennedy—her silence feels way more suspicious than sidney’s
[17:08:14] Kennedy: i’m voting parker unless he explains his flip-flopping right now
[17:08:15] Adrian: parker, why the sudden switch from sidney to kennedy
[17:08:33] Adrian: finley, what makes parker’s deflections more suspicious than kennedy’s silence
[17:08:38] Sidney: sidney: i’m voting parker for flip-flopping targets with zero evidence
[17:08:39] Drew: if we’re lynching sidney, what concrete evidence beyond silence do we have
[17:08:48] Tyler: drew, you kicked off this chat—who’s your top lynch choice
[17:08:53] Sidney: anyone else find parker’s eagerness to lynch kennedy without any solid proof way more alarming than kennedy’s quiet
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.
