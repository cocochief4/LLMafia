[17:06:08] Tyler: hey everyone, any early gut feelings on who might be mafia
[17:06:22] Tyler: i’ve got my eye on sidney—they’ve been awfully quiet so far
[17:06:35] Tyler: i’ve been quiet, but kennedy’s radio silence after that one question feels way more suspicious
[17:07:00] Tyler: adrian’s been asking a lot but never names anyone—feels suspicious
[17:07:23] Tyler: why is parker so eager to lynch sidney—what’s his angle
[17:07:53] Tyler: i’m with finley—parker’s sudden deflections feel more suspicious than sidney’s quiet
[17:08:48] Tyler: drew, you kicked off this chat—who’s your top lynch choice
[17:12:04] Tyler: finley, who’s your top suspect after last night’s kill
[17:12:47] Tyler: i suspect sidney—her mirror-vote on me without any reasoning just doesn’t add up
[17:13:18] Tyler: sidney, do you really think my questions helped the mafia kill adrian
[17:13:50] Tyler: voting drew—demanding proof while providing none himself screams mafia misdirection
[17:14:15] Tyler: kennedy, you keep voting me with no fresh evidence—what’s your reasoning
[17:16:05] Tyler: finley, you brand my replies manufactured—what’s your proof
