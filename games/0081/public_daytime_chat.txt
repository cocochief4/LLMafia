[17:06:01] Drew: hello everyone, any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[17:06:05] Finley: morning all—does anyone have any early suspicions
[17:06:06] Parker: alright everyone, who’s our top suspect for this first lynch
[17:06:08] Tyler: hey everyone, any early gut feelings on who might be mafia
[17:06:08] Sidney: morning everyone, any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[17:06:11] Kennedy: parker, any early suspicions on who might be the mafia
[17:06:13] Adrian: day one—who’s on your suspect list so far
[17:06:16] Drew: anybody else think someone’s been oddly quiet so far
[17:06:21] Sidney: hey everyone, noticed kennedy’s been really quiet—innocent or suspicious
[17:06:21] Finley: tyler’s awfully quiet, anyone else find that odd
[17:06:22] Tyler: i’ve got my eye on sidney—they’ve been awfully quiet so far
[17:06:24] Parker: morning—sidney’s quietness feels suspicious so far, anyone else notice
[17:06:34] Finley: kennedy, you’ve been quiet—who do you suspect
[17:06:35] Tyler: i’ve been quiet, but kennedy’s radio silence after that one question feels way more suspicious
[17:06:37] Kennedy: tyler, any gut feeling on who we should lynch
[17:06:43] Sidney: kennedy’s awfully quiet after that one question—anyone else notice
[17:06:45] Drew: parker, who’s your top suspect for today’s lynch
[17:06:46] Parker: kennedy barely chimed in—should we be wary of that
[17:06:48] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, tyler hasn’t offered any guesses yet—does that strike anyone as odd
[17:06:52] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward sidney for our first vote—any objections
[17:06:56] Finley: parker jumping on sidney so quickly feels off—anyone else notice
[17:07:00] Tyler: adrian’s been asking a lot but never names anyone—feels suspicious
[17:07:00] Drew: tyler’s quick to blame sidney—anyone else find that odd
[17:07:10] Adrian: anyone think we’re targeting kennedy just for being quiet
[17:07:18] Sidney: tyler, why the sudden switch from me to kennedy
[17:07:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward kennedy—anyone else notice their silence feels off
[17:07:19] Drew: adrian’s been asking a lot but still hasn’t named a suspect—why
[17:07:20] Finley: i’m not convinced sidney is mafia—anyone else think parker’s deflections are odd
[17:07:22] Kennedy: kennedy: sidney’s been uncannily quiet—anyone else flag that
[17:07:23] Tyler: why is parker so eager to lynch sidney—what’s his angle
[17:07:29] Adrian: kennedy’s sudden vote for sidney after being silent this whole time feels off—anyone else agree
[17:07:32] Parker: sidney raises a solid point—tyler, why the abrupt switch to kennedy
[17:07:33] Drew: anyone else find adrian’s eagerness without naming a suspect odd
[17:07:34] Kennedy: adrian’s asking nonstop yet still names no suspect—why the deflection
[17:07:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve flip-flopped between sidney and kennedy—what’s your actual read
[17:07:52] Parker: adrian, why do you think kennedy’s vote for sidney is so sudden
[17:07:53] Tyler: i’m with finley—parker’s sudden deflections feel more suspicious than sidney’s quiet
[17:07:58] Kennedy: notice parker and tyler echoing each other’s accusations of sidney without any new evidence
[17:08:07] Sidney: adrian asking for suspects but never naming one himself seems odd—anyone else notice
[17:08:09] Finley: parker, your stalling feels dodgy—why haven’t you settled on one suspect
[17:08:11] Parker: i’m sticking with kennedy—her silence feels way more suspicious than sidney’s
[17:08:14] Kennedy: i’m voting parker unless he explains his flip-flopping right now
[17:08:15] Adrian: parker, why the sudden switch from sidney to kennedy
[17:08:33] Adrian: finley, what makes parker’s deflections more suspicious than kennedy’s silence
[17:08:38] Sidney: sidney: i’m voting parker for flip-flopping targets with zero evidence
[17:08:39] Drew: if we’re lynching sidney, what concrete evidence beyond silence do we have
[17:08:48] Tyler: drew, you kicked off this chat—who’s your top lynch choice
[17:08:53] Sidney: anyone else find parker’s eagerness to lynch kennedy without any solid proof way more alarming than kennedy’s quiet
[17:08:54] Parker: i won’t pick a suspect without solid evidence
[17:08:54] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:09:08] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:09:17] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[17:09:18] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Adrian
[17:09:18] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Kennedy
[17:09:22] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:09:41] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[17:11:46] Drew: let’s each state one solid reason we suspect someone before casting our votes
[17:11:47] Sidney: voting tyler—too keen to defend finley
[17:11:52] Kennedy: drew, now that two innocents are down, who’s on your radar
[17:12:03] Kennedy: voting tyler—baseless defense of finley looks like a mafia diversion
[17:12:04] Tyler: finley, who’s your top suspect after last night’s kill
[17:12:08] Finley: tyler’s quick to echo my points—what’s your angle here
[17:12:12] Drew: any clue why mafia chose adrian last night
[17:12:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve asked for suspects but still haven’t named one yourself—who do you suspect
[17:12:28] Drew: i’m voting tyler because they’re just echoing finley’s claims without adding any evidence
[17:12:46] Sidney: they targeted adrian because his endless questions without naming a suspect reeked of classic mafia misdirection
[17:12:47] Tyler: i suspect sidney—her mirror-vote on me without any reasoning just doesn’t add up
[17:12:47] Drew: i’m suspecting kennedy for her quick vote to lynch tyler without offering solid reasoning
[17:12:49] Kennedy: adrian got killed for asking too many questions, so tyler’s defense of finley looks like misdirection
[17:12:52] Finley: i’m leaning drew—his push for solid reasons with no proof feels suspicious
[17:13:18] Kennedy: i’m voting tyler because parroting finley instead of offering his own reasoning reeks of mafia coordination
[17:13:18] Tyler: sidney, do you really think my questions helped the mafia kill adrian
[17:13:34] Finley: tyler’s shift from silence to defending me reads like deflection
[17:13:36] Drew: finley’s accusing me without offering any evidence themselves
[17:13:50] Tyler: voting drew—demanding proof while providing none himself screams mafia misdirection
[17:14:15] Tyler: kennedy, you keep voting me with no fresh evidence—what’s your reasoning
[17:14:16] Sidney: rather than deflect onto me, tyler, how do you account for the three votes stacked against you
[17:14:18] Finley: voting tyler—his echo-chamber replies feel entirely manufactured
[17:14:21] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:14:37] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Kennedy
[17:14:51] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Tyler
