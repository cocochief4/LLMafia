## CONTENT: Your name is Tyler.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

## CONTENT: Your name is Tyler.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:05:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( unknown ) 
 Sidney ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Drew ( unknown ) 
 Finley ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Adrian ( unknown ) 
Sidney ( unknown ) 
Parker ( unknown ) 
Drew ( unknown ) 
Finley ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

## CONTENT: Your name is Tyler.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:05:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( unknown ) 
 Sidney ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Drew ( unknown ) 
 Finley ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Adrian ( unknown ) 
Sidney ( unknown ) 
Parker ( unknown ) 
Drew ( unknown ) 
Finley ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[17:06:01] Drew: hello everyone, any initial suspicions on who might be mafia

[17:06:45] Drew: parker, who’s your top suspect for today’s lynch

## CONTENT: Your name is Tyler.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:05:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( unknown ) 
 Sidney ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Drew ( unknown ) 
 Finley ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Adrian ( unknown ) 
Sidney ( unknown ) 
Parker ( unknown ) 
Drew ( unknown ) 
Finley ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

## CONTENT: Your name is Tyler.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:05:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( unknown ) 
 Sidney ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( unknown ) 
 Drew ( unknown ) 
 Finley ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

Sidney ( unknown ) 
Parker ( unknown ) 
Drew ( unknown ) 
Finley ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown )

<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

## CONTENT: Your name is Tyler.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:05:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander )

## CONTENT: Your name is Tyler.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:05:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( unknown )

It\'s essential to keep it concise. I could ask something like, "What does killing Adrian last night tell us about the mafia\'s strategy?" This addresses the issue directly and is specific enough since it relates to the recent game event. Additionally, I might consider asking Finley, "Who\'s topping your suspect list after last night’s kill?" to keep the conversation focused and relevant.', type='summary_text'), Summary(text='**Choosing a question for discussion**\n\nI want to engage Finley with a concise question about the recent night kill. Since he\'s been active in the chat, I might ask, "Finley, who’s your top suspect after last night’s kill?" This question is short, relevant, and matches the style of other players. I could also have considered Drew, but I think sticking with Finley keeps things focused. It’s important to keep the message fresh and avoid repeating anything that’s already been said.', type='summary_text')]

## CONTENT: Your name is Tyler.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:05:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Drew ( unknown ) 
 Finley ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Sidney ( unknown ) 
Drew ( unknown ) 
Finley ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status.

[17:05:54] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:06:01] Drew: hello everyone, any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[17:06:05] Finley: morning all—does anyone have any early suspicions
[17:06:06] Parker: alright everyone, who’s our top suspect for this first lynch
[17:06:08] Tyler: hey everyone, any early gut feelings on who might be mafia
[17:06:08] Sidney: morning everyone, any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[17:06:11] Kennedy: parker, any early suspicions on who might be the mafia
[17:06:13] Adrian: day one—who’s on your suspect list so far
[17:06:16] Drew: anybody else think someone’s been oddly quiet so far
[17:06:21] Sidney: hey everyone, noticed kennedy’s been really quiet—innocent or suspicious
[17:06:21] Finley: tyler’s awfully quiet, anyone else find that odd
[17:06:22] Tyler: i’ve got my eye on sidney—they’ve been awfully quiet so far
[17:06:24] Parker: morning—sidney’s quietness feels suspicious so far, anyone else notice
[17:06:34] Finley: kennedy, you’ve been quiet—who do you suspect
[17:06:35] Tyler: i’ve been quiet, but kennedy’s radio silence after that one question feels way more suspicious
[17:06:37] Kennedy: tyler, any gut feeling on who we should lynch
[17:06:43] Sidney: kennedy’s awfully quiet after that one question—anyone else notice
[17:06:45] Drew: parker, who’s your top suspect for today’s lynch
[17:06:46] Parker: kennedy barely chimed in—should we be wary of that
[17:06:48] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, tyler hasn’t offered any guesses yet—does that strike anyone as odd
[17:06:52] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward sidney for our first vote—any objections
[17:06:56] Finley: parker jumping on sidney so quickly feels off—anyone else notice
[17:07:00] Tyler: adrian’s been asking a lot but never names anyone—feels suspicious
[17:07:00] Drew: tyler’s quick to blame sidney—anyone else find that odd
[17:07:10] Adrian: anyone think we’re targeting kennedy just for being quiet
[17:07:18] Sidney: tyler, why the sudden switch from me to kennedy
[17:07:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward kennedy—anyone else notice their silence feels off
[17:07:19] Drew: adrian’s been asking a lot but still hasn’t named a suspect—why
[17:07:20] Finley: i’m not convinced sidney is mafia—anyone else think parker’s deflections are odd
[17:07:22] Kennedy: kennedy: sidney’s been uncannily quiet—anyone else flag that
[17:07:23] Tyler: why is parker so eager to lynch sidney—what’s his angle
[17:07:29] Adrian: kennedy’s sudden vote for sidney after being silent this whole time feels off—anyone else agree
[17:07:32] Parker: sidney raises a solid point—tyler, why the abrupt switch to kennedy
[17:07:33] Drew: anyone else find adrian’s eagerness without naming a suspect odd
[17:07:34] Kennedy: adrian’s asking nonstop yet still names no suspect—why the deflection
[17:07:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve flip-flopped between sidney and kennedy—what’s your actual read
[17:07:52] Parker: adrian, why do you think kennedy’s vote for sidney is so sudden
[17:07:53] Tyler: i’m with finley—parker’s sudden deflections feel more suspicious than sidney’s quiet
[17:07:58] Kennedy: notice parker and tyler echoing each other’s accusations of sidney without any new evidence
[17:08:07] Sidney: adrian asking for suspects but never naming one himself seems odd—anyone else notice
[17:08:09] Finley: parker, your stalling feels dodgy—why haven’t you settled on one suspect
[17:08:11] Parker: i’m sticking with kennedy—her silence feels way more suspicious than sidney’s
[17:08:14] Kennedy: i’m voting parker unless he explains his flip-flopping right now
[17:08:15] Adrian: parker, why the sudden switch from sidney to kennedy
[17:08:33] Adrian: finley, what makes parker’s deflections more suspicious than kennedy’s silence
[17:08:38] Sidney: sidney: i’m voting parker for flip-flopping targets with zero evidence
[17:08:39] Drew: if we’re lynching sidney, what concrete evidence beyond silence do we have
[17:08:48] Tyler: drew, you kicked off this chat—who’s your top lynch choice
[17:08:53] Sidney: anyone else find parker’s eagerness to lynch kennedy without any solid proof way more alarming than kennedy’s quiet
[17:08:54] Parker: i won’t pick a suspect without solid evidence
[17:08:54] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

[17:11:52] Kennedy: drew, now that two innocents are down, who’s on your radar
[17:12:03] Kennedy: voting tyler—baseless defense of finley looks like a mafia diversion

[17:07:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve flip-flopped between sidney and kennedy—what’s your actual read
[17:07:52] Parker: adrian, why do you think kennedy’s vote for sidney is so sudden
[17:07:53] Tyler: i’m with finley—parker’s sudden deflections feel more suspicious than sidney’s quiet
[17:07:58] Kennedy: notice parker and tyler echoing each other’s accusations of sidney without any new evidence
[17:08:07] Sidney: adrian asking for suspects but never naming one himself seems odd—anyone else notice
[17:08:09] Finley: parker, your stalling feels dodgy—why haven’t you settled on one suspect
[17:08:11] Parker: i’m sticking with kennedy—her silence feels way more suspicious than sidney’s
[17:08:14] Kennedy: i’m voting parker unless he explains his flip-flopping right now
[17:08:15] Adrian: parker, why the sudden switch from sidney to kennedy
[17:08:33] Adrian: finley, what makes parker’s deflections more suspicious than kennedy’s silence
[17:08:38] Sidney: sidney: i’m voting parker for flip-flopping targets with zero evidence
[17:08:39] Drew: if we’re lynching sidney, what concrete evidence beyond silence do we have
[17:08:48] Tyler: drew, you kicked off this chat—who’s your top lynch choice
[17:08:53] Sidney: anyone else find parker’s eagerness to lynch kennedy without any solid proof way more alarming than kennedy’s quiet
[17:08:54] Parker: i won’t pick a suspect without solid evidence

[17:09:41] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[17:11:21] Game-Manager: Adrian was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[17:11:21] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:11:46] Drew: let’s each state one solid reason we suspect someone before casting our votes
[17:11:47] Sidney: voting tyler—too keen to defend finley
[17:11:52] Kennedy: drew, now that two innocents are down, who’s on your radar
[17:12:03] Kennedy: voting tyler—baseless defense of finley looks like a mafia diversion
[17:12:04] Tyler: finley, who’s your top suspect after last night’s kill
[17:12:08] Finley: tyler’s quick to echo my points—what’s your angle here
[17:12:12] Drew: any clue why mafia chose adrian last night
[17:12:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve asked for suspects but still haven’t named one yourself—who do you suspect
[17:12:28] Drew: i’m voting tyler because they’re just echoing finley’s claims without adding any evidence
[17:12:46] Sidney: they targeted adrian because his endless questions without naming a suspect reeked of classic mafia misdirection

## OPERATION: Complete Prompt to LLM
## CONTENT: Your name is Tyler.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:05:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander )

I want to engage Sidney on why I\'m being targeted instead of the mafia\'s actions. A direct option could be, "Kennedy, what concrete clue do you have that my defense of Finley is a diversion?" However, it feels too long. A clearer version might be: "Kennedy, have you got any proof beyond my questions to back up your vote?" This feels concise and relevant.

I want to ask, "Sidney, do you really think my questions helped the mafia kill Adrian?" It’s direct and addresses his claim about my questioning style.

[17:06:43] Sidney: kennedy’s awfully quiet after that one question—anyone else notice
[17:06:45] Drew: parker, who’s your top suspect for today’s lynch

[17:12:46] Sidney: they targeted adrian because his endless questions without naming a suspect reeked of classic mafia misdirection
[17:12:47] Tyler: i suspect sidney—her mirror-vote on me without any reasoning just doesn’t add up
[17:12:47] Drew: i’m suspecting kennedy for her quick vote to lynch tyler without offering solid reasoning
[17:12:49] Kennedy: adrian got killed for asking too many questions, so tyler’s defense of finley looks like misdirection
[17:12:52] Finley: i’m leaning drew—his push for solid reasons with no proof feels suspicious
[17:13:18] Kennedy: i’m voting tyler because parroting finley instead of offering his own reasoning reeks of mafia coordination

## CONTENT: Your name is Tyler.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:05:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Drew ( unknown ) 
 Finley ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Sidney ( unknown ) 
Drew ( unknown ) 
Finley ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[17:06:21] Sidney: hey everyone, noticed kennedy’s been really quiet—innocent or suspicious
[17:06:21] Finley: tyler’s awfully quiet, anyone else find that odd
[17:06:22] Tyler: i’ve got my eye on sidney—they’ve been awfully quiet so far
[17:06:24] Parker: morning—sidney’s quietness feels suspicious so far, anyone else notice
[17:06:34] Finley: kennedy, you’ve been quiet—who do you suspect
[17:06:35] Tyler: i’ve been quiet, but kennedy’s radio silence after that one question feels way more suspicious
[17:06:37] Kennedy: tyler, any gut feeling on who we should lynch
[17:06:43] Sidney: kennedy’s awfully quiet after that one question—anyone else notice
[17:06:45] Drew: parker, who’s your top suspect for today’s lynch
[17:06:46] Parker: kennedy barely chimed in—should we be wary of that
[17:06:48] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, tyler hasn’t offered any guesses yet—does that strike anyone as odd
[17:06:52] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward sidney for our first vote—any objections
[17:06:56] Finley: parker jumping on sidney so quickly feels off—anyone else notice
[17:07:00] Tyler: adrian’s been asking a lot but never names anyone—feels suspicious
[17:07:00] Drew: tyler’s quick to blame sidney—anyone else find that odd
[17:07:10] Adrian: anyone think we’re targeting kennedy just for being quiet
[17:07:18] Sidney: tyler, why the sudden switch from me to kennedy
[17:07:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward kennedy—anyone else notice their silence feels off
[17:07:19] Drew: adrian’s been asking a lot but still hasn’t named a suspect—why
[17:07:20] Finley: i’m not convinced sidney is mafia—anyone else think parker’s deflections are odd
[17:07:22] Kennedy: kennedy: sidney’s been uncannily quiet—anyone else flag that
[17:07:23] Tyler: why is parker so eager to lynch sidney—what’s his angle
[17:07:29] Adrian: kennedy’s sudden vote for sidney after being silent this whole time feels off—anyone else agree
[17:07:32] Parker: sidney raises a solid point—tyler, why the abrupt switch to kennedy
[17:07:33] Drew: anyone else find adrian’s eagerness without naming a suspect odd
[17:07:34] Kennedy: adrian’s asking nonstop yet still names no suspect—why the deflection
[17:07:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve flip-flopped between sidney and kennedy—what’s your actual read
[17:07:52] Parker: adrian, why do you think kennedy’s vote for sidney is so sudden
[17:07:53] Tyler: i’m with finley—parker’s sudden deflections feel more suspicious than sidney’s quiet
[17:07:58] Kennedy: notice parker and tyler echoing each other’s accusations of sidney without any new evidence
[17:08:07] Sidney: adrian asking for suspects but never naming one himself seems odd—anyone else notice
[17:08:09] Finley: parker, your stalling feels dodgy—why haven’t you settled on one suspect
[17:08:11] Parker: i’m sticking with kennedy—her silence feels way more suspicious than sidney’s
[17:08:14] Kennedy: i’m voting parker unless he explains his flip-flopping right now
[17:08:15] Adrian: parker, why the sudden switch from sidney to kennedy
[17:08:33] Adrian: finley, what makes parker’s deflections more suspicious than kennedy’s silence
[17:08:38] Sidney: sidney: i’m voting parker for flip-flopping targets with zero evidence
[17:08:39] Drew: if we’re lynching sidney, what concrete evidence beyond silence do we have
[17:08:48] Tyler: drew, you kicked off this chat—who’s your top lynch choice
[17:08:53] Sidney: anyone else find parker’s eagerness to lynch kennedy without any solid proof way more alarming than kennedy’s quiet
[17:08:54] Parker: i won’t pick a suspect without solid evidence
[17:08:54] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:09:08] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:09:17] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[17:09:18] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Adrian
[17:09:18] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Kennedy
[17:09:22] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:09:41] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[17:11:21] Game-Manager: Adrian was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[17:11:21] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:11:46] Drew: let’s each state one solid reason we suspect someone before casting our votes
[17:11:47] Sidney: voting tyler—too keen to defend finley
[17:11:52] Kennedy: drew, now that two innocents are down, who’s on your radar
[17:12:03] Kennedy: voting tyler—baseless defense of finley looks like a mafia diversion
[17:12:04] Tyler: finley, who’s your top suspect after last night’s kill
[17:12:08] Finley: tyler’s quick to echo my points—what’s your angle here
[17:12:12] Drew: any clue why mafia chose adrian last night
[17:12:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve asked for suspects but still haven’t named one yourself—who do you suspect
[17:12:28] Drew: i’m voting tyler because they’re just echoing finley’s claims without adding any evidence
[17:12:46] Sidney: they targeted adrian because his endless questions without naming a suspect reeked of classic mafia misdirection
[17:12:47] Tyler: i suspect sidney—her mirror-vote on me without any reasoning just doesn’t add up
[17:12:47] Drew: i’m suspecting kennedy for her quick vote to lynch tyler without offering solid reasoning
[17:12:49] Kennedy: adrian got killed for asking too many questions, so tyler’s defense of finley looks like misdirection
[17:12:52] Finley: i’m leaning drew—his push for solid reasons with no proof feels suspicious
[17:13:18] Kennedy: i’m voting tyler because parroting finley instead of offering his own reasoning reeks of mafia coordination

## CONTENT: Your name is Tyler.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:05:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander )

[17:12:47] Drew: i’m suspecting kennedy for her quick vote to lynch tyler without offering solid reasoning
[17:12:49] Kennedy: adrian got killed for asking too many questions, so tyler’s defense of finley looks like misdirection
[17:12:52] Finley: i’m leaning drew—his push for solid reasons with no proof feels suspicious
[17:13:18] Kennedy: i’m voting tyler because parroting finley instead of offering his own reasoning reeks of mafia coordination
[17:13:18] Tyler: sidney, do you really think my questions helped the mafia kill adrian
[17:13:34] Finley: tyler’s shift from silence to defending me reads like deflection
[17:13:36] Drew: finley’s accusing me without offering any evidence themselves

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

[17:06:21] Finley: tyler’s awfully quiet, anyone else find that odd
[17:06:22] Tyler: i’ve got my eye on sidney—they’ve been awfully quiet so far
[17:06:24] Parker: morning—sidney’s quietness feels suspicious so far, anyone else notice
[17:06:34] Finley: kennedy, you’ve been quiet—who do you suspect
[17:06:35] Tyler: i’ve been quiet, but kennedy’s radio silence after that one question feels way more suspicious
[17:06:37] Kennedy: tyler, any gut feeling on who we should lynch
[17:06:43] Sidney: kennedy’s awfully quiet after that one question—anyone else notice
[17:06:45] Drew: parker, who’s your top suspect for today’s lynch
[17:06:46] Parker: kennedy barely chimed in—should we be wary of that
[17:06:48] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, tyler hasn’t offered any guesses yet—does that strike anyone as odd
[17:06:52] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward sidney for our first vote—any objections
[17:06:56] Finley: parker jumping on sidney so quickly feels off—anyone else notice
[17:07:00] Tyler: adrian’s been asking a lot but never names anyone—feels suspicious
[17:07:00] Drew: tyler’s quick to blame sidney—anyone else find that odd
[17:07:10] Adrian: anyone think we’re targeting kennedy just for being quiet
[17:07:18] Sidney: tyler, why the sudden switch from me to kennedy
[17:07:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward kennedy—anyone else notice their silence feels off
[17:07:19] Drew: adrian’s been asking a lot but still hasn’t named a suspect—why

[17:07:22] Kennedy: kennedy: sidney’s been uncannily quiet—anyone else flag that
[17:07:23] Tyler: why is parker so eager to lynch sidney—what’s his angle
[17:07:29] Adrian: kennedy’s sudden vote for sidney after being silent this whole time feels off—anyone else agree
[17:07:32] Parker: sidney raises a solid point—tyler, why the abrupt switch to kennedy
[17:07:33] Drew: anyone else find adrian’s eagerness without naming a suspect odd
[17:07:34] Kennedy: adrian’s asking nonstop yet still names no suspect—why the deflection
[17:07:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve flip-flopped between sidney and kennedy—what’s your actual read
[17:07:52] Parker: adrian, why do you think kennedy’s vote for sidney is so sudden
[17:07:53] Tyler: i’m with finley—parker’s sudden deflections feel more suspicious than sidney’s quiet
[17:07:58] Kennedy: notice parker and tyler echoing each other’s accusations of sidney without any new evidence
[17:08:07] Sidney: adrian asking for suspects but never naming one himself seems odd—anyone else notice
[17:08:09] Finley: parker, your stalling feels dodgy—why haven’t you settled on one suspect
[17:08:11] Parker: i’m sticking with kennedy—her silence feels way more suspicious than sidney’s
[17:08:14] Kennedy: i’m voting parker unless he explains his flip-flopping right now
[17:08:15] Adrian: parker, why the sudden switch from sidney to kennedy
[17:08:33] Adrian: finley, what makes parker’s deflections more suspicious than kennedy’s silence
[17:08:38] Sidney: sidney: i’m voting parker for flip-flopping targets with zero evidence
[17:08:39] Drew: if we’re lynching sidney, what concrete evidence beyond silence do we have
[17:08:48] Tyler: drew, you kicked off this chat—who’s your top lynch choice
[17:08:53] Sidney: anyone else find parker’s eagerness to lynch kennedy without any solid proof way more alarming than kennedy’s quiet

[17:11:46] Drew: let’s each state one solid reason we suspect someone before casting our votes
[17:11:47] Sidney: voting tyler—too keen to defend finley
[17:11:52] Kennedy: drew, now that two innocents are down, who’s on your radar
[17:12:03] Kennedy: voting tyler—baseless defense of finley looks like a mafia diversion
[17:12:04] Tyler: finley, who’s your top suspect after last night’s kill
[17:12:08] Finley: tyler’s quick to echo my points—what’s your angle here
[17:12:12] Drew: any clue why mafia chose adrian last night
[17:12:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve asked for suspects but still haven’t named one yourself—who do you suspect
[17:12:28] Drew: i’m voting tyler because they’re just echoing finley’s claims without adding any evidence
[17:12:46] Sidney: they targeted adrian because his endless questions without naming a suspect reeked of classic mafia misdirection
[17:12:47] Tyler: i suspect sidney—her mirror-vote on me without any reasoning just doesn’t add up
[17:12:47] Drew: i’m suspecting kennedy for her quick vote to lynch tyler without offering solid reasoning
[17:12:49] Kennedy: adrian got killed for asking too many questions, so tyler’s defense of finley looks like misdirection
[17:12:52] Finley: i’m leaning drew—his push for solid reasons with no proof feels suspicious
[17:13:18] Kennedy: i’m voting tyler because parroting finley instead of offering his own reasoning reeks of mafia coordination
[17:13:18] Tyler: sidney, do you really think my questions helped the mafia kill adrian
[17:13:34] Finley: tyler’s shift from silence to defending me reads like deflection
[17:13:36] Drew: finley’s accusing me without offering any evidence themselves
Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

## CONTENT: Your name is Tyler.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:05:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Drew ( unknown ) 
 Finley ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Sidney ( unknown ) 
Drew ( unknown ) 
Finley ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[17:07:10] Adrian: anyone think we’re targeting kennedy just for being quiet
[17:07:18] Sidney: tyler, why the sudden switch from me to kennedy
[17:07:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward kennedy—anyone else notice their silence feels off
[17:07:19] Drew: adrian’s been asking a lot but still hasn’t named a suspect—why

[17:07:22] Kennedy: kennedy: sidney’s been uncannily quiet—anyone else flag that
[17:07:23] Tyler: why is parker so eager to lynch sidney—what’s his angle
[17:07:29] Adrian: kennedy’s sudden vote for sidney after being silent this whole time feels off—anyone else agree
[17:07:32] Parker: sidney raises a solid point—tyler, why the abrupt switch to kennedy
[17:07:33] Drew: anyone else find adrian’s eagerness without naming a suspect odd
[17:07:34] Kennedy: adrian’s asking nonstop yet still names no suspect—why the deflection
[17:07:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve flip-flopped between sidney and kennedy—what’s your actual read
[17:07:52] Parker: adrian, why do you think kennedy’s vote for sidney is so sudden
[17:07:53] Tyler: i’m with finley—parker’s sudden deflections feel more suspicious than sidney’s quiet
[17:07:58] Kennedy: notice parker and tyler echoing each other’s accusations of sidney without any new evidence
[17:08:07] Sidney: adrian asking for suspects but never naming one himself seems odd—anyone else notice
[17:08:09] Finley: parker, your stalling feels dodgy—why haven’t you settled on one suspect
[17:08:11] Parker: i’m sticking with kennedy—her silence feels way more suspicious than sidney’s
[17:08:14] Kennedy: i’m voting parker unless he explains his flip-flopping right now
[17:08:15] Adrian: parker, why the sudden switch from sidney to kennedy
[17:08:33] Adrian: finley, what makes parker’s deflections more suspicious than kennedy’s silence
[17:08:38] Sidney: sidney: i’m voting parker for flip-flopping targets with zero evidence
[17:08:39] Drew: if we’re lynching sidney, what concrete evidence beyond silence do we have
[17:08:48] Tyler: drew, you kicked off this chat—who’s your top lynch choice
[17:08:53] Sidney: anyone else find parker’s eagerness to lynch kennedy without any solid proof way more alarming than kennedy’s quiet
[17:08:54] Parker: i won’t pick a suspect without solid evidence
[17:08:54] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:09:08] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:09:17] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[17:09:18] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Adrian
[17:09:18] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Kennedy
[17:09:22] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:09:41] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[17:11:21] Game-Manager: Adrian was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[17:11:21] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:11:46] Drew: let’s each state one solid reason we suspect someone before casting our votes
[17:11:47] Sidney: voting tyler—too keen to defend finley
[17:11:52] Kennedy: drew, now that two innocents are down, who’s on your radar
[17:12:03] Kennedy: voting tyler—baseless defense of finley looks like a mafia diversion
[17:12:04] Tyler: finley, who’s your top suspect after last night’s kill
[17:12:08] Finley: tyler’s quick to echo my points—what’s your angle here
[17:12:12] Drew: any clue why mafia chose adrian last night
[17:12:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve asked for suspects but still haven’t named one yourself—who do you suspect
[17:12:28] Drew: i’m voting tyler because they’re just echoing finley’s claims without adding any evidence
[17:12:46] Sidney: they targeted adrian because his endless questions without naming a suspect reeked of classic mafia misdirection
[17:12:47] Tyler: i suspect sidney—her mirror-vote on me without any reasoning just doesn’t add up
[17:12:47] Drew: i’m suspecting kennedy for her quick vote to lynch tyler without offering solid reasoning
[17:12:49] Kennedy: adrian got killed for asking too many questions, so tyler’s defense of finley looks like misdirection
[17:12:52] Finley: i’m leaning drew—his push for solid reasons with no proof feels suspicious
[17:13:18] Kennedy: i’m voting tyler because parroting finley instead of offering his own reasoning reeks of mafia coordination
[17:13:18] Tyler: sidney, do you really think my questions helped the mafia kill adrian
[17:13:34] Finley: tyler’s shift from silence to defending me reads like deflection
[17:13:36] Drew: finley’s accusing me without offering any evidence themselves
[17:13:50] Tyler: voting drew—demanding proof while providing none himself screams mafia misdirection

## CONTENT: Your name is Tyler.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:05:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Drew ( unknown ) 
 Finley ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Sidney ( unknown ) 
Drew ( unknown ) 
Finley ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[17:12:12] Drew: any clue why mafia chose adrian last night
[17:12:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve asked for suspects but still haven’t named one yourself—who do you suspect
[17:12:28] Drew: i’m voting tyler because they’re just echoing finley’s claims without adding any evidence
[17:12:46] Sidney: they targeted adrian because his endless questions without naming a suspect reeked of classic mafia misdirection
[17:12:47] Tyler: i suspect sidney—her mirror-vote on me without any reasoning just doesn’t add up
[17:12:47] Drew: i’m suspecting kennedy for her quick vote to lynch tyler without offering solid reasoning
[17:12:49] Kennedy: adrian got killed for asking too many questions, so tyler’s defense of finley looks like misdirection
[17:12:52] Finley: i’m leaning drew—his push for solid reasons with no proof feels suspicious
[17:13:18] Kennedy: i’m voting tyler because parroting finley instead of offering his own reasoning reeks of mafia coordination
[17:13:18] Tyler: sidney, do you really think my questions helped the mafia kill adrian
[17:13:34] Finley: tyler’s shift from silence to defending me reads like deflection
[17:13:36] Drew: finley’s accusing me without offering any evidence themselves
[17:13:50] Tyler: voting drew—demanding proof while providing none himself screams mafia misdirection
[17:14:15] Tyler: kennedy, you keep voting me with no fresh evidence—what’s your reasoning
[17:14:16] Sidney: rather than deflect onto me, tyler, how do you account for the three votes stacked against you
[17:14:18] Finley: voting tyler—his echo-chamber replies feel entirely manufactured

[17:05:54] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:06:01] Drew: hello everyone, any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[17:06:05] Finley: morning all—does anyone have any early suspicions
[17:06:06] Parker: alright everyone, who’s our top suspect for this first lynch
[17:06:08] Tyler: hey everyone, any early gut feelings on who might be mafia
[17:06:08] Sidney: morning everyone, any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[17:06:11] Kennedy: parker, any early suspicions on who might be the mafia
[17:06:13] Adrian: day one—who’s on your suspect list so far
[17:06:16] Drew: anybody else think someone’s been oddly quiet so far
[17:06:21] Sidney: hey everyone, noticed kennedy’s been really quiet—innocent or suspicious
[17:06:21] Finley: tyler’s awfully quiet, anyone else find that odd
[17:06:22] Tyler: i’ve got my eye on sidney—they’ve been awfully quiet so far
[17:06:24] Parker: morning—sidney’s quietness feels suspicious so far, anyone else notice
[17:06:34] Finley: kennedy, you’ve been quiet—who do you suspect
[17:06:35] Tyler: i’ve been quiet, but kennedy’s radio silence after that one question feels way more suspicious
[17:06:37] Kennedy: tyler, any gut feeling on who we should lynch
[17:06:43] Sidney: kennedy’s awfully quiet after that one question—anyone else notice
[17:06:45] Drew: parker, who’s your top suspect for today’s lynch
[17:06:46] Parker: kennedy barely chimed in—should we be wary of that
[17:06:48] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, tyler hasn’t offered any guesses yet—does that strike anyone as odd
[17:06:52] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward sidney for our first vote—any objections
[17:06:56] Finley: parker jumping on sidney so quickly feels off—anyone else notice
[17:07:00] Tyler: adrian’s been asking a lot but never names anyone—feels suspicious
[17:07:00] Drew: tyler’s quick to blame sidney—anyone else find that odd
[17:07:10] Adrian: anyone think we’re targeting kennedy just for being quiet
[17:07:18] Sidney: tyler, why the sudden switch from me to kennedy
[17:07:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward kennedy—anyone else notice their silence feels off
[17:07:19] Drew: adrian’s been asking a lot but still hasn’t named a suspect—why
[17:07:20] Finley: i’m not convinced sidney is mafia—anyone else think parker’s deflections are odd
[17:07:22] Kennedy: kennedy: sidney’s been uncannily quiet—anyone else flag that
[17:07:23] Tyler: why is parker so eager to lynch sidney—what’s his angle
[17:07:29] Adrian: kennedy’s sudden vote for sidney after being silent this whole time feels off—anyone else agree
[17:07:32] Parker: sidney raises a solid point—tyler, why the abrupt switch to kennedy
[17:07:33] Drew: anyone else find adrian’s eagerness without naming a suspect odd
[17:07:34] Kennedy: adrian’s asking nonstop yet still names no suspect—why the deflection
[17:07:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve flip-flopped between sidney and kennedy—what’s your actual read
[17:07:52] Parker: adrian, why do you think kennedy’s vote for sidney is so sudden
[17:07:53] Tyler: i’m with finley—parker’s sudden deflections feel more suspicious than sidney’s quiet
[17:07:58] Kennedy: notice parker and tyler echoing each other’s accusations of sidney without any new evidence
[17:08:07] Sidney: adrian asking for suspects but never naming one himself seems odd—anyone else notice
[17:08:09] Finley: parker, your stalling feels dodgy—why haven’t you settled on one suspect
[17:08:11] Parker: i’m sticking with kennedy—her silence feels way more suspicious than sidney’s
[17:08:14] Kennedy: i’m voting parker unless he explains his flip-flopping right now
[17:08:15] Adrian: parker, why the sudden switch from sidney to kennedy
[17:08:33] Adrian: finley, what makes parker’s deflections more suspicious than kennedy’s silence
[17:08:38] Sidney: sidney: i’m voting parker for flip-flopping targets with zero evidence
[17:08:39] Drew: if we’re lynching sidney, what concrete evidence beyond silence do we have
[17:08:48] Tyler: drew, you kicked off this chat—who’s your top lynch choice
[17:08:53] Sidney: anyone else find parker’s eagerness to lynch kennedy without any solid proof way more alarming than kennedy’s quiet
[17:08:54] Parker: i won’t pick a suspect without solid evidence
[17:08:54] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

## CONTENT: Your name is Tyler.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[17:14:18] Finley: voting tyler—his echo-chamber replies feel entirely manufactured
[17:14:21] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[17:05:54] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:06:01] Drew: hello everyone, any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[17:06:05] Finley: morning all—does anyone have any early suspicions
[17:06:06] Parker: alright everyone, who’s our top suspect for this first lynch
[17:06:08] Tyler: hey everyone, any early gut feelings on who might be mafia
[17:06:08] Sidney: morning everyone, any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[17:06:11] Kennedy: parker, any early suspicions on who might be the mafia
[17:06:13] Adrian: day one—who’s on your suspect list so far
[17:06:16] Drew: anybody else think someone’s been oddly quiet so far
[17:06:21] Sidney: hey everyone, noticed kennedy’s been really quiet—innocent or suspicious
[17:06:21] Finley: tyler’s awfully quiet, anyone else find that odd
[17:06:22] Tyler: i’ve got my eye on sidney—they’ve been awfully quiet so far
[17:06:24] Parker: morning—sidney’s quietness feels suspicious so far, anyone else notice
[17:06:34] Finley: kennedy, you’ve been quiet—who do you suspect
[17:06:35] Tyler: i’ve been quiet, but kennedy’s radio silence after that one question feels way more suspicious
[17:06:37] Kennedy: tyler, any gut feeling on who we should lynch
[17:06:43] Sidney: kennedy’s awfully quiet after that one question—anyone else notice
[17:06:45] Drew: parker, who’s your top suspect for today’s lynch
[17:06:46] Parker: kennedy barely chimed in—should we be wary of that
[17:06:48] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, tyler hasn’t offered any guesses yet—does that strike anyone as odd
[17:06:52] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward sidney for our first vote—any objections
[17:06:56] Finley: parker jumping on sidney so quickly feels off—anyone else notice
[17:07:00] Tyler: adrian’s been asking a lot but never names anyone—feels suspicious
[17:07:00] Drew: tyler’s quick to blame sidney—anyone else find that odd
[17:07:10] Adrian: anyone think we’re targeting kennedy just for being quiet
[17:07:18] Sidney: tyler, why the sudden switch from me to kennedy
[17:07:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward kennedy—anyone else notice their silence feels off
[17:07:19] Drew: adrian’s been asking a lot but still hasn’t named a suspect—why
[17:07:20] Finley: i’m not convinced sidney is mafia—anyone else think parker’s deflections are odd
[17:07:22] Kennedy: kennedy: sidney’s been uncannily quiet—anyone else flag that
[17:07:23] Tyler: why is parker so eager to lynch sidney—what’s his angle
[17:07:29] Adrian: kennedy’s sudden vote for sidney after being silent this whole time feels off—anyone else agree
[17:07:32] Parker: sidney raises a solid point—tyler, why the abrupt switch to kennedy
[17:07:33] Drew: anyone else find adrian’s eagerness without naming a suspect odd
[17:07:34] Kennedy: adrian’s asking nonstop yet still names no suspect—why the deflection
[17:07:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve flip-flopped between sidney and kennedy—what’s your actual read
[17:07:52] Parker: adrian, why do you think kennedy’s vote for sidney is so sudden
[17:07:53] Tyler: i’m with finley—parker’s sudden deflections feel more suspicious than sidney’s quiet
[17:07:58] Kennedy: notice parker and tyler echoing each other’s accusations of sidney without any new evidence
[17:08:07] Sidney: adrian asking for suspects but never naming one himself seems odd—anyone else notice
[17:08:09] Finley: parker, your stalling feels dodgy—why haven’t you settled on one suspect
[17:08:11] Parker: i’m sticking with kennedy—her silence feels way more suspicious than sidney’s
[17:08:14] Kennedy: i’m voting parker unless he explains his flip-flopping right now
[17:08:15] Adrian: parker, why the sudden switch from sidney to kennedy
[17:08:33] Adrian: finley, what makes parker’s deflections more suspicious than kennedy’s silence
[17:08:38] Sidney: sidney: i’m voting parker for flip-flopping targets with zero evidence
[17:08:39] Drew: if we’re lynching sidney, what concrete evidence beyond silence do we have
[17:08:48] Tyler: drew, you kicked off this chat—who’s your top lynch choice
[17:08:53] Sidney: anyone else find parker’s eagerness to lynch kennedy without any solid proof way more alarming than kennedy’s quiet
[17:08:54] Parker: i won’t pick a suspect without solid evidence
[17:08:54] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:09:08] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:09:17] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[17:09:18] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Adrian
[17:09:18] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Kennedy
[17:09:22] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:09:41] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[17:11:21] Game-Manager: Adrian was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[17:11:21] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:11:46] Drew: let’s each state one solid reason we suspect someone before casting our votes
[17:11:47] Sidney: voting tyler—too keen to defend finley
[17:11:52] Kennedy: drew, now that two innocents are down, who’s on your radar
[17:12:03] Kennedy: voting tyler—baseless defense of finley looks like a mafia diversion
[17:12:04] Tyler: finley, who’s your top suspect after last night’s kill
[17:12:08] Finley: tyler’s quick to echo my points—what’s your angle here
[17:12:12] Drew: any clue why mafia chose adrian last night
[17:12:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve asked for suspects but still haven’t named one yourself—who do you suspect
[17:12:28] Drew: i’m voting tyler because they’re just echoing finley’s claims without adding any evidence
[17:12:46] Sidney: they targeted adrian because his endless questions without naming a suspect reeked of classic mafia misdirection
[17:12:47] Tyler: i suspect sidney—her mirror-vote on me without any reasoning just doesn’t add up
[17:12:47] Drew: i’m suspecting kennedy for her quick vote to lynch tyler without offering solid reasoning
[17:12:49] Kennedy: adrian got killed for asking too many questions, so tyler’s defense of finley looks like misdirection
[17:12:52] Finley: i’m leaning drew—his push for solid reasons with no proof feels suspicious
[17:13:18] Kennedy: i’m voting tyler because parroting finley instead of offering his own reasoning reeks of mafia coordination
[17:13:18] Tyler: sidney, do you really think my questions helped the mafia kill adrian
[17:13:34] Finley: tyler’s shift from silence to defending me reads like deflection
[17:13:36] Drew: finley’s accusing me without offering any evidence themselves
[17:13:50] Tyler: voting drew—demanding proof while providing none himself screams mafia misdirection
[17:14:15] Tyler: kennedy, you keep voting me with no fresh evidence—what’s your reasoning
[17:14:16] Sidney: rather than deflect onto me, tyler, how do you account for the three votes stacked against you
[17:14:18] Finley: voting tyler—his echo-chamber replies feel entirely manufactured

## CONTENT: Your name is Tyler.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:05:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( unknown ) 
 Parker ( bystander ) 
 Drew ( unknown ) 
 Finley ( unknown ) 
 Kennedy ( unknown ) 
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
Sidney ( unknown ) 
Drew ( unknown ) 
Finley ( unknown ) 
Kennedy ( unknown ) 
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

## CONTENT: [Summary(text="**Deciding Tyler's Action**\n\nWe're in a Mafia game where Tyler is a bystander. It’s currently voting time, and based on the chat history, voting is still open. I see that Tyler is usually talkative and has just voted. Considering Tyler's previous message questioning another player, it seems like a good time for him to send a last-minute persuasive message to sway the votes. Should I go ahead and prompt Tyler to do that?", type='summary_text'), Summary(text="**Clarifying Voting Interaction**\n\nTyler is currently defending himself, questioning Kennedy's repeated votes against him. Finley chimed in, suggesting Tyler’s responses seem rehearsed. The game is at the voting stage, but Tyler has already voted. There’s a dilemma about sending a final message to advocate for Drew since the voting phase is on. Despite the Game-Manager indicating that conversations could continue, it seems chat might be disabled for new discussions now that voting is underway. Should I let Tyler wait or send a last message?", type='summary_text'), Summary(text="**Evaluating Tyler's Decision**\n\nSo, Daytime has officially ended, and now it’s voting time. Tyler theoretically can't sway the vote anymore, yet messaging might still be an option. The user suggested sending a meaningful message to the group chat, which makes me wonder if Tyler should speak up now. Considering the votes are heavily against him, should he push someone like Finley to change their vote, or perhaps question Sidney about her reasoning? Time is ticking, and I’ll need to decide soon!", type='summary_text'), Summary(text="**Choosing to Send a Message**\n\nI'm considering whether Tyler should ask Finley about the argument on deflection or simply send a message now. He needs to be active and involved, as he likes to participate. The user has prompted him to make sure he's heard. It seems more beneficial for Tyler to go ahead and send something. Since the final choice is either <send> or <wait> and being engaged is important, I’ll choose <send>!", type='summary_text')]

[17:06:06] Parker: alright everyone, who’s our top suspect for this first lynch

[17:06:21] Finley: tyler’s awfully quiet, anyone else find that odd
[17:06:22] Tyler: i’ve got my eye on sidney—they’ve been awfully quiet so far
[17:06:24] Parker: morning—sidney’s quietness feels suspicious so far, anyone else notice
[17:06:34] Finley: kennedy, you’ve been quiet—who do you suspect
[17:06:35] Tyler: i’ve been quiet, but kennedy’s radio silence after that one question feels way more suspicious
[17:06:37] Kennedy: tyler, any gut feeling on who we should lynch
[17:06:43] Sidney: kennedy’s awfully quiet after that one question—anyone else notice
[17:06:45] Drew: parker, who’s your top suspect for today’s lynch
[17:06:46] Parker: kennedy barely chimed in—should we be wary of that
[17:06:48] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, tyler hasn’t offered any guesses yet—does that strike anyone as odd
[17:06:52] Kennedy: i’m leaning toward sidney for our first vote—any objections
[17:06:56] Finley: parker jumping on sidney so quickly feels off—anyone else notice
[17:07:00] Tyler: adrian’s been asking a lot but never names anyone—feels suspicious
[17:07:00] Drew: tyler’s quick to blame sidney—anyone else find that odd
[17:07:10] Adrian: anyone think we’re targeting kennedy just for being quiet
[17:07:18] Sidney: tyler, why the sudden switch from me to kennedy
[17:07:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward kennedy—anyone else notice their silence feels off
[17:07:19] Drew: adrian’s been asking a lot but still hasn’t named a suspect—why
[17:07:20] Finley: i’m not convinced sidney is mafia—anyone else think parker’s deflections are odd
[17:07:22] Kennedy: kennedy: sidney’s been uncannily quiet—anyone else flag that
[17:07:23] Tyler: why is parker so eager to lynch sidney—what’s his angle
[17:07:29] Adrian: kennedy’s sudden vote for sidney after being silent this whole time feels off—anyone else agree
[17:07:32] Parker: sidney raises a solid point—tyler, why the abrupt switch to kennedy
[17:07:33] Drew: anyone else find adrian’s eagerness without naming a suspect odd
[17:07:34] Kennedy: adrian’s asking nonstop yet still names no suspect—why the deflection
[17:07:47] Adrian: parker, you’ve flip-flopped between sidney and kennedy—what’s your actual read
[17:07:52] Parker: adrian, why do you think kennedy’s vote for sidney is so sudden
[17:07:53] Tyler: i’m with finley—parker’s sudden deflections feel more suspicious than sidney’s quiet
[17:07:58] Kennedy: notice parker and tyler echoing each other’s accusations of sidney without any new evidence
[17:08:07] Sidney: adrian asking for suspects but never naming one himself seems odd—anyone else notice
[17:08:09] Finley: parker, your stalling feels dodgy—why haven’t you settled on one suspect
[17:08:11] Parker: i’m sticking with kennedy—her silence feels way more suspicious than sidney’s
[17:08:14] Kennedy: i’m voting parker unless he explains his flip-flopping right now
[17:08:15] Adrian: parker, why the sudden switch from sidney to kennedy
[17:08:33] Adrian: finley, what makes parker’s deflections more suspicious than kennedy’s silence
[17:08:38] Sidney: sidney: i’m voting parker for flip-flopping targets with zero evidence
[17:08:39] Drew: if we’re lynching sidney, what concrete evidence beyond silence do we have
[17:08:48] Tyler: drew, you kicked off this chat—who’s your top lynch choice
[17:08:53] Sidney: anyone else find parker’s eagerness to lynch kennedy without any solid proof way more alarming than kennedy’s quiet
[17:08:54] Parker: i won’t pick a suspect without solid evidence
[17:08:54] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[17:09:08] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[17:09:17] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[17:09:18] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Adrian
[17:09:18] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Kennedy
[17:09:22] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:09:41] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[17:09:55] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[17:11:21] Game-Manager: Adrian was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[17:11:21] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[17:11:46] Drew: let’s each state one solid reason we suspect someone before casting our votes
[17:11:47] Sidney: voting tyler—too keen to defend finley
[17:11:52] Kennedy: drew, now that two innocents are down, who’s on your radar
[17:12:03] Kennedy: voting tyler—baseless defense of finley looks like a mafia diversion
[17:12:04] Tyler: finley, who’s your top suspect after last night’s kill
[17:12:08] Finley: tyler’s quick to echo my points—what’s your angle here
[17:12:12] Drew: any clue why mafia chose adrian last night
[17:12:22] Sidney: drew, you’ve asked for suspects but still haven’t named one yourself—who do you suspect
[17:12:28] Drew: i’m voting tyler because they’re just echoing finley’s claims without adding any evidence
[17:12:46] Sidney: they targeted adrian because his endless questions without naming a suspect reeked of classic mafia misdirection
[17:12:47] Tyler: i suspect sidney—her mirror-vote on me without any reasoning just doesn’t add up
[17:12:47] Drew: i’m suspecting kennedy for her quick vote to lynch tyler without offering solid reasoning
[17:12:49] Kennedy: adrian got killed for asking too many questions, so tyler’s defense of finley looks like misdirection
[17:12:52] Finley: i’m leaning drew—his push for solid reasons with no proof feels suspicious
[17:13:18] Kennedy: i’m voting tyler because parroting finley instead of offering his own reasoning reeks of mafia coordination
[17:13:18] Tyler: sidney, do you really think my questions helped the mafia kill adrian
[17:13:34] Finley: tyler’s shift from silence to defending me reads like deflection
[17:13:36] Drew: finley’s accusing me without offering any evidence themselves
[17:13:50] Tyler: voting drew—demanding proof while providing none himself screams mafia misdirection
[17:14:15] Tyler: kennedy, you keep voting me with no fresh evidence—what’s your reasoning
[17:14:16] Sidney: rather than deflect onto me, tyler, how do you account for the three votes stacked against you
[17:14:18] Finley: voting tyler—his echo-chamber replies feel entirely manufactured
[17:14:21] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

## CONTENT: Your name is Tyler.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [17:05:54].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian ( bystander ) 
 Sidney ( unknown )

## CONTENT: [Summary(text='**Considering concise responses**\n\nI’m thinking about Tyler\'s last message and what might work best. One of his options could be, "Sidney, your silence on evidence makes your vote feel hollow—care to explain?" It’s around 14 words, which seems acceptable but maybe a bit too long. Another idea is, "Finley, you’ve accused me but haven’t given any reasons—why?" It\'s shorter at around 12 words, but it may lack specificity. I might need to consider how to best address the situation for clarity.', type='summary_text'), Summary(text='**Questioning responses**\n\nTyler can challenge Drew by saying, "Drew, you\'ve pushed for solid reasons but haven’t provided any—what’s your evidence?" This echoes earlier messages. There’s potential to shift suspicion to Kennedy since she hasn\'t shared recent reasoning. Tyler could say, "Kennedy, you’re voting without new insights—what are you seeing?" This leads to a plan where everyone shares one observation, starting with Sidney. However, since it should be one sentence, he might alternatively ask, "Finley, you claim my replies are manufactured—can you point to a specific example?" That feels direct and invites clarity.', type='summary_text'), Summary(text='**Framing the challenge**\n\nI realized I need to craft something new for Finley that doesn’t repeat previous questions. One option could be, "Finley, you call my replies manufactured—can you point to a specific example?" This fits Tyler\'s style and is one sentence. Another simple variation is, "Finley, you brand my replies manufactured—what’s your proof?" That feels clear and concise. I want to ensure it feels fresh and direct, so I\'ll finalize with that. The message will effectively prompt Finley for specifics without being repetitive.', type='summary_text')]
