[17:06:05] Finley: morning all—does anyone have any early suspicions
[17:06:21] Finley: tyler’s awfully quiet, anyone else find that odd
[17:06:34] Finley: kennedy, you’ve been quiet—who do you suspect
[17:06:56] Finley: parker jumping on sidney so quickly feels off—anyone else notice
[17:07:20] Finley: i’m not convinced sidney is mafia—anyone else think parker’s deflections are odd
[17:08:09] Finley: parker, your stalling feels dodgy—why haven’t you settled on one suspect
[17:10:18] Finley: voting parker—his flip-flopping reads like classic mafia misdirection
[17:12:08] Finley: tyler’s quick to echo my points—what’s your angle here
[17:12:52] Finley: i’m leaning drew—his push for solid reasons with no proof feels suspicious
[17:13:34] Finley: tyler’s shift from silence to defending me reads like deflection
[17:14:18] Finley: voting tyler—his echo-chamber replies feel entirely manufactured
