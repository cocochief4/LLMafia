[17:06:48] Adrian: adrian: hey everyone, tyler hasn’t offered any guesses yet—does that strike anyone as odd
[17:07:10] Adrian: anyone think we’re targeting kennedy just for being quiet
[17:07:29] Adrian: kennedy’s sudden vote for sidney after being silent this whole time feels off—anyone else agree
