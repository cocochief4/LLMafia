[17:06:06] Parker: alright everyone, who’s our top suspect for this first lynch
[17:06:24] Parker: morning—sidney’s quietness feels suspicious so far, anyone else notice
[17:06:46] Parker: kennedy barely chimed in—should we be wary of that
[17:07:18] Parker: i’m leaning toward kennedy—anyone else notice their silence feels off
[17:07:32] Parker: sidney raises a solid point—tyler, why the abrupt switch to kennedy
[17:07:52] Parker: adrian, why do you think kennedy’s vote for sidney is so sudden
[17:08:11] Parker: i’m sticking with kennedy—her silence feels way more suspicious than sidney’s
[17:08:54] Parker: i won’t pick a suspect without solid evidence
