[17:06:01] Drew: hello everyone, any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[17:06:16] Drew: anybody else think someone’s been oddly quiet so far
[17:06:45] Drew: parker, who’s your top suspect for today’s lynch
[17:07:00] Drew: tyler’s quick to blame sidney—anyone else find that odd
[17:07:19] Drew: adrian’s been asking a lot but still hasn’t named a suspect—why
[17:07:33] Drew: anyone else find adrian’s eagerness without naming a suspect odd
[17:08:39] Drew: if we’re lynching sidney, what concrete evidence beyond silence do we have
[17:11:46] Drew: let’s each state one solid reason we suspect someone before casting our votes
[17:12:12] Drew: any clue why mafia chose adrian last night
[17:12:28] Drew: i’m voting tyler because they’re just echoing finley’s claims without adding any evidence
[17:12:47] Drew: i’m suspecting kennedy for her quick vote to lynch tyler without offering solid reasoning
[17:13:36] Drew: finley’s accusing me without offering any evidence themselves
