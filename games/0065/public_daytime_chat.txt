[15:59:50] Skylar: it's daytime—any observations from last night
[15:59:50] Bailey: morning everyone—anyone have a gut hunch on who the mafia might be
[15:59:55] Casey: im ready to go
[15:59:57] Skylar: anyone have initial suspicions so we can narrow down our vote
[16:00:00] Bailey: i didn’t hear anything unusual last night, but casey’s sudden quiet seemed odd
[16:00:06] Casey: I think we need to think it through
[16:00:11] Casey: Bailey you are quick to point fingers
[16:00:14] Bailey: casey jumped in kinda fast, does that strike anyone else as odd
[16:00:16] Skylar: casey you’ve been awfully quiet, what do you think happened last night
[16:00:24] Bailey: skylar, do you find casey’s sudden quietness suspicious
[16:00:28] Skylar: casey, what makes bailey’s quick accusation seem odd to you
[16:00:28] Casey: I think taylor has been awfully quiet, what is your case?
[16:00:42] Skylar: silence isn’t a crime—did casey do anything else suspicious last night
[16:00:46] Bailey: casey, can you share what you were doing last night
[16:01:02] Casey: I think that it is more concerning that taylor is not saying much, her silence is very telling
[16:01:29] Bailey: casey, who is taylor supposed to be
[16:01:37] Casey: is she not in the game?
[16:01:42] Skylar: taylor, mind telling us what you were doing last night since you’ve been so quiet
