[15:59:50] Bailey: morning everyone—anyone have a gut hunch on who the mafia might be
[16:00:00] Bailey: i didn’t hear anything unusual last night, but casey’s sudden quiet seemed odd
[16:00:14] Bailey: casey jumped in kinda fast, does that strike anyone else as odd
[16:00:24] Bailey: skylar, do you find casey’s sudden quietness suspicious
[16:00:46] Bailey: casey, can you share what you were doing last night
[16:01:29] Bailey: casey, who is taylor supposed to be
[16:02:14] Bailey: i’m voting casey unless someone has a better defense
