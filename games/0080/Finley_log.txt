## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. + 
 + Do you understand the rules? +

Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:37:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:37:00] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:37:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)

<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:37:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:37:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:37:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:37:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia.

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:37:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Tyler (mafia)
 Kennedy (bystander)
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

[16:40:11] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker

## OPERATION: Complete Prompt to LLM
## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:37:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Tyler (mafia)
 Kennedy (bystander)
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:37:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)

## OPERATION: Complete Prompt to LLM
## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:37:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Sidney (bystander)
 Parker (mafia)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (mafia)
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:37:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:37:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Sidney (bystander)
 Parker (mafia)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (mafia)
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:37:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Sidney (bystander)
 Parker (mafia)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (mafia)

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:37:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Sidney (bystander)
 Parker (mafia)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (mafia)
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:37:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

[16:39:05] Finley: adrian’s deflecting onto sidney seems as flimsy as sidney’s rush to lynch drew

[16:39:18] Tyler: sidney’s eagerness to vote drew without any evidence seems odd—anyone else feel that

[16:42:59] Parker: tyler’s constant finger-pointing without offering his own theory feels suspicious

[16:43:13] Finley: parker’s vote for kennedy last round felt random—what was your reasoning
[16:43:21] Tyler: parker’s sudden shift to accusing me with no evidence feels like a diversion
[16:43:31] Parker: tyler, you voted for me last round—what made you pick me
[16:43:38] Kennedy: parker, why did you vote for me last round
[16:43:45] Finley: parker’s shift from kennedy to tyler feels fishy—anyone else notice
[16:43:46] Tyler: i voted you because you’ve been deflecting onto others without any evidence
[16:43:56] Kennedy: finley, you pushed drew hard—why so quiet now
[16:44:06] Parker: i voted kennedy because she went silent right after pushing drew, which felt fishier than any of my shifts

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:37:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Sidney (bystander)
 Parker (mafia)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (mafia)

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:37:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Sidney (bystander)
 Parker (mafia)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (mafia)
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[16:37:19] Parker: not much yet, but tyler’s silence is making me uneasy
[16:37:23] Drew: with only three minutes left, who does everyone suspect
[16:37:24] Tyler: hey everyone, any thoughts on why drew’s been so quiet
[16:37:24] Sidney: drew hasn’t spoken up yet—does that strike anyone as odd

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:37:00] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:37:07] Finley: hey everyone, ready to kick off day 1—anyone strike you as suspicious already
[16:37:10] Parker: hey everyone, any early hunches on who the mafia might be
[16:37:10] Tyler: not much to go on yet—anyone have early suspicions
[16:37:11] Sidney: morning all—any early suspicions on who the mafia could be
[16:37:13] Adrian: anyone have any gut feelings on who might be mafia
[16:37:16] Finley: morning all, does anyone already have a gut feeling on who to vote today
[16:37:18] Kennedy: any thoughts on who to vote out first
[16:37:19] Parker: not much yet, but tyler’s silence is making me uneasy
[16:37:23] Drew: with only three minutes left, who does everyone suspect
[16:37:24] Tyler: hey everyone, any thoughts on why drew’s been so quiet
[16:37:24] Sidney: drew hasn’t spoken up yet—does that strike anyone as odd
[16:37:28] Finley: i noticed drew’s been pretty quiet so far—does that strike anyone else as odd
[16:37:32] Adrian: hey everyone, sidney’s been awfully eager—anyone else find that a bit suspicious
[16:37:36] Tyler: parker jumping on my quietness seems odd—anyone else feel that
[16:37:36] Sidney: drew, any input from you would be helpful before we vote
[16:37:38] Kennedy: anyone else feel like drew’s been awfully quiet
[16:37:38] Drew: is tyler’s silence really the best lead we have right now
[16:37:50] Drew: sorry for the quiet—i’m suspicious of sidney’s eagerness for quick votes
[16:37:51] Adrian: drew, mind speaking up and sharing who you suspect
[16:37:52] Finley: drew’s silence really sticks out—should we vote him today
[16:38:03] Kennedy: does anyone else find it odd that finley is so eager to push a vote
[16:38:04] Tyler: finley’s focus on drew seems odd—anyone else
[16:38:09] Adrian: parker’s quick call‐out of tyler seems as suspect as sidney’s vote push—what’s your take
[16:38:09] Parker: sidney’s pushing drew nonstop—does anyone else find that fishy
[16:38:11] Drew: i’m leaning toward voting adrian since he’s quick to deflect onto sidney
[16:38:21] Adrian: we’re targeting drew on gut feeling—can anyone suggest another lead
[16:38:22] Kennedy: shouldn’t we ask sidney for specifics before rushing to vote drew
[16:38:37] Sidney: parker and adrian, why is finley’s call to vote drew fine but my identical suggestion fishy
[16:38:37] Kennedy: sidney’s relentless focus on drew without any real evidence seems way more suspicious
[16:38:40] Drew: sidney’s tunnel vision on me feels odd—does anyone else find that fishy
[16:38:42] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to push a vote seems more suspicious than anything i’ve said
[16:38:55] Tyler: kennedy’s vague comments seem off—anyone else notice
[16:38:57] Parker: finley’s eagerness to nail drew makes me wonder what they’re hiding
[16:39:03] Sidney: i noticed adrian flip from accusing me to drew with zero proof—what’s his angle
[16:39:05] Finley: adrian’s deflecting onto sidney seems as flimsy as sidney’s rush to lynch drew
[16:39:12] Parker: parker: kennedy’s vagueness seems off—anyone else notice that
[16:39:18] Tyler: sidney’s eagerness to vote drew without any evidence seems odd—anyone else feel that
[16:39:20] Drew: why is finley’s call to vote drew fine but sidney’s identical one fishy
[16:39:30] Finley: adrian’s flip from sidney to drew with zero explanation feels way fishy
[16:39:35] Drew: kennedy, you’ve been vague all game—what concrete evidence do you have
[16:39:37] Sidney: kennedy’s dodging details—what’s she hiding
[16:39:40] Adrian: finley’s rush to paint me as a deflector without specifics feels just as fishy—anyone else agree
[16:39:42] Kennedy: parker, where exactly do you find my comments vague
[16:39:43] Tyler: tyler: parker’s rapid target shifts strike me as odd—thoughts
[16:39:58] Finley: why is drew so quick to vote adrian instead of answering any questions
[16:40:00] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:40:11] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[16:40:51] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.

[16:42:18] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Adrian
[16:42:24] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Adrian
[16:42:59] Parker: tyler’s constant finger-pointing without offering his own theory feels suspicious
[16:43:03] Tyler: finley’s sudden silence after their earlier push feels fishy—anyone else notice
[16:43:13] Finley: parker’s vote for kennedy last round felt random—what was your reasoning
[16:43:21] Tyler: parker’s sudden shift to accusing me with no evidence feels like a diversion
[16:43:31] Parker: tyler, you voted for me last round—what made you pick me
[16:43:38] Kennedy: parker, why did you vote for me last round
[16:43:45] Finley: parker’s shift from kennedy to tyler feels fishy—anyone else notice
[16:43:46] Tyler: i voted you because you’ve been deflecting onto others without any evidence
[16:43:56] Kennedy: finley, you pushed drew hard—why so quiet now
[16:44:06] Parker: i voted kennedy because she went silent right after pushing drew, which felt fishier than any of my shifts
[16:44:31] Finley: kennedy, you voted for sidney last round—what was your read
[16:44:35] Sidney: we’ve just lynched two innocents—what concrete evidence do we have against parker
[16:44:43] Kennedy: parker, why the sudden switch from voting me to accusing tyler—what changed your mind
[16:44:57] Finley: finley: parker, isn’t your sudden shift from kennedy to tyler more suspicious than kennedy’s brief silence
[16:44:59] Parker: sidney, what evidence points to me as mafia

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:37:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Sidney (bystander)
 Parker (mafia)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (mafia)

[16:44:06] Parker: i voted kennedy because she went silent right after pushing drew, which felt fishier than any of my shifts
[16:44:31] Finley: kennedy, you voted for sidney last round—what was your read
[16:44:35] Sidney: we’ve just lynched two innocents—what concrete evidence do we have against parker
[16:44:43] Kennedy: parker, why the sudden switch from voting me to accusing tyler—what changed your mind
[16:44:57] Finley: finley: parker, isn’t your sudden shift from kennedy to tyler more suspicious than kennedy’s brief silence
[16:44:59] Parker: sidney, what evidence points to me as mafia

[16:37:00] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:37:07] Finley: hey everyone, ready to kick off day 1—anyone strike you as suspicious already
[16:37:10] Parker: hey everyone, any early hunches on who the mafia might be
[16:37:10] Tyler: not much to go on yet—anyone have early suspicions
[16:37:11] Sidney: morning all—any early suspicions on who the mafia could be
[16:37:13] Adrian: anyone have any gut feelings on who might be mafia
[16:37:16] Finley: morning all, does anyone already have a gut feeling on who to vote today
[16:37:18] Kennedy: any thoughts on who to vote out first
[16:37:19] Parker: not much yet, but tyler’s silence is making me uneasy
[16:37:23] Drew: with only three minutes left, who does everyone suspect
[16:37:24] Tyler: hey everyone, any thoughts on why drew’s been so quiet
[16:37:24] Sidney: drew hasn’t spoken up yet—does that strike anyone as odd
[16:37:28] Finley: i noticed drew’s been pretty quiet so far—does that strike anyone else as odd
[16:37:32] Adrian: hey everyone, sidney’s been awfully eager—anyone else find that a bit suspicious
[16:37:36] Tyler: parker jumping on my quietness seems odd—anyone else feel that
[16:37:36] Sidney: drew, any input from you would be helpful before we vote
[16:37:38] Kennedy: anyone else feel like drew’s been awfully quiet
[16:37:38] Drew: is tyler’s silence really the best lead we have right now
[16:37:50] Drew: sorry for the quiet—i’m suspicious of sidney’s eagerness for quick votes
[16:37:51] Adrian: drew, mind speaking up and sharing who you suspect
[16:37:52] Finley: drew’s silence really sticks out—should we vote him today
[16:38:03] Kennedy: does anyone else find it odd that finley is so eager to push a vote
[16:38:04] Tyler: finley’s focus on drew seems odd—anyone else
[16:38:09] Adrian: parker’s quick call‐out of tyler seems as suspect as sidney’s vote push—what’s your take
[16:38:09] Parker: sidney’s pushing drew nonstop—does anyone else find that fishy
[16:38:11] Drew: i’m leaning toward voting adrian since he’s quick to deflect onto sidney
[16:38:21] Adrian: we’re targeting drew on gut feeling—can anyone suggest another lead
[16:38:22] Kennedy: shouldn’t we ask sidney for specifics before rushing to vote drew
[16:38:37] Sidney: parker and adrian, why is finley’s call to vote drew fine but my identical suggestion fishy
[16:38:37] Kennedy: sidney’s relentless focus on drew without any real evidence seems way more suspicious

[16:39:12] Parker: parker: kennedy’s vagueness seems off—anyone else notice that
[16:39:18] Tyler: sidney’s eagerness to vote drew without any evidence seems odd—anyone else feel that

## OPERATION: Complete Prompt to LLM
## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:37:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Sidney (bystander)
 Parker (mafia)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (mafia)
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

[16:43:45] Finley: parker’s shift from kennedy to tyler feels fishy—anyone else notice

[16:44:57] Finley: finley: parker, isn’t your sudden shift from kennedy to tyler more suspicious than kennedy’s brief silence
[16:44:59] Parker: sidney, what evidence points to me as mafia

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:37:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)

The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

## OPERATION: Complete Prompt to LLM
## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:37:00].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Sidney (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:37:00] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:37:07] Finley: hey everyone, ready to kick off day 1—anyone strike you as suspicious already
[16:37:10] Parker: hey everyone, any early hunches on who the mafia might be
[16:37:10] Tyler: not much to go on yet—anyone have early suspicions
[16:37:11] Sidney: morning all—any early suspicions on who the mafia could be
[16:37:13] Adrian: anyone have any gut feelings on who might be mafia
[16:37:16] Finley: morning all, does anyone already have a gut feeling on who to vote today
[16:37:18] Kennedy: any thoughts on who to vote out first
[16:37:19] Parker: not much yet, but tyler’s silence is making me uneasy
[16:37:23] Drew: with only three minutes left, who does everyone suspect
[16:37:24] Tyler: hey everyone, any thoughts on why drew’s been so quiet
[16:37:24] Sidney: drew hasn’t spoken up yet—does that strike anyone as odd
[16:37:28] Finley: i noticed drew’s been pretty quiet so far—does that strike anyone else as odd
[16:37:32] Adrian: hey everyone, sidney’s been awfully eager—anyone else find that a bit suspicious
[16:37:36] Tyler: parker jumping on my quietness seems odd—anyone else feel that
[16:37:36] Sidney: drew, any input from you would be helpful before we vote
[16:37:38] Kennedy: anyone else feel like drew’s been awfully quiet
[16:37:38] Drew: is tyler’s silence really the best lead we have right now
[16:37:50] Drew: sorry for the quiet—i’m suspicious of sidney’s eagerness for quick votes
[16:37:51] Adrian: drew, mind speaking up and sharing who you suspect
[16:37:52] Finley: drew’s silence really sticks out—should we vote him today
[16:38:03] Kennedy: does anyone else find it odd that finley is so eager to push a vote
[16:38:04] Tyler: finley’s focus on drew seems odd—anyone else
[16:38:09] Adrian: parker’s quick call‐out of tyler seems as suspect as sidney’s vote push—what’s your take
[16:38:09] Parker: sidney’s pushing drew nonstop—does anyone else find that fishy
[16:38:11] Drew: i’m leaning toward voting adrian since he’s quick to deflect onto sidney
[16:38:21] Adrian: we’re targeting drew on gut feeling—can anyone suggest another lead
[16:38:22] Kennedy: shouldn’t we ask sidney for specifics before rushing to vote drew
[16:38:37] Sidney: parker and adrian, why is finley’s call to vote drew fine but my identical suggestion fishy
[16:38:37] Kennedy: sidney’s relentless focus on drew without any real evidence seems way more suspicious
[16:38:40] Drew: sidney’s tunnel vision on me feels odd—does anyone else find that fishy
[16:38:42] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to push a vote seems more suspicious than anything i’ve said
[16:38:55] Tyler: kennedy’s vague comments seem off—anyone else notice
[16:38:57] Parker: finley’s eagerness to nail drew makes me wonder what they’re hiding
[16:39:03] Sidney: i noticed adrian flip from accusing me to drew with zero proof—what’s his angle
[16:39:05] Finley: adrian’s deflecting onto sidney seems as flimsy as sidney’s rush to lynch drew
[16:39:12] Parker: parker: kennedy’s vagueness seems off—anyone else notice that
[16:39:18] Tyler: sidney’s eagerness to vote drew without any evidence seems odd—anyone else feel that
[16:39:20] Drew: why is finley’s call to vote drew fine but sidney’s identical one fishy
[16:39:30] Finley: adrian’s flip from sidney to drew with zero explanation feels way fishy
[16:39:35] Drew: kennedy, you’ve been vague all game—what concrete evidence do you have
[16:39:37] Sidney: kennedy’s dodging details—what’s she hiding
[16:39:40] Adrian: finley’s rush to paint me as a deflector without specifics feels just as fishy—anyone else agree
[16:39:42] Kennedy: parker, where exactly do you find my comments vague
[16:39:43] Tyler: tyler: parker’s rapid target shifts strike me as odd—thoughts
[16:39:58] Finley: why is drew so quick to vote adrian instead of answering any questions
