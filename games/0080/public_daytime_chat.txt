[16:37:07] Finley: hey everyone, ready to kick off day 1—anyone strike you as suspicious already
[16:37:10] Parker: hey everyone, any early hunches on who the mafia might be
[16:37:10] Tyler: not much to go on yet—anyone have early suspicions
[16:37:11] Sidney: morning all—any early suspicions on who the mafia could be
[16:37:13] Adrian: anyone have any gut feelings on who might be mafia
[16:37:16] Finley: morning all, does anyone already have a gut feeling on who to vote today
[16:37:18] Kennedy: any thoughts on who to vote out first
[16:37:19] Parker: not much yet, but tyler’s silence is making me uneasy
[16:37:23] Drew: with only three minutes left, who does everyone suspect
[16:37:24] Tyler: hey everyone, any thoughts on why drew’s been so quiet
[16:37:24] Sidney: drew hasn’t spoken up yet—does that strike anyone as odd
[16:37:28] Finley: i noticed drew’s been pretty quiet so far—does that strike anyone else as odd
[16:37:32] Adrian: hey everyone, sidney’s been awfully eager—anyone else find that a bit suspicious
[16:37:36] Tyler: parker jumping on my quietness seems odd—anyone else feel that
[16:37:36] Sidney: drew, any input from you would be helpful before we vote
[16:37:38] Kennedy: anyone else feel like drew’s been awfully quiet
[16:37:38] Drew: is tyler’s silence really the best lead we have right now
[16:37:50] Drew: sorry for the quiet—i’m suspicious of sidney’s eagerness for quick votes
[16:37:51] Adrian: drew, mind speaking up and sharing who you suspect
[16:37:52] Finley: drew’s silence really sticks out—should we vote him today
[16:38:03] Kennedy: does anyone else find it odd that finley is so eager to push a vote
[16:38:04] Tyler: finley’s focus on drew seems odd—anyone else
[16:38:09] Adrian: parker’s quick call‐out of tyler seems as suspect as sidney’s vote push—what’s your take
[16:38:09] Parker: sidney’s pushing drew nonstop—does anyone else find that fishy
[16:38:11] Drew: i’m leaning toward voting adrian since he’s quick to deflect onto sidney
[16:38:21] Adrian: we’re targeting drew on gut feeling—can anyone suggest another lead
[16:38:22] Kennedy: shouldn’t we ask sidney for specifics before rushing to vote drew
[16:38:37] Sidney: parker and adrian, why is finley’s call to vote drew fine but my identical suggestion fishy
[16:38:37] Kennedy: sidney’s relentless focus on drew without any real evidence seems way more suspicious
[16:38:40] Drew: sidney’s tunnel vision on me feels odd—does anyone else find that fishy
[16:38:42] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to push a vote seems more suspicious than anything i’ve said
[16:38:55] Tyler: kennedy’s vague comments seem off—anyone else notice
[16:38:57] Parker: finley’s eagerness to nail drew makes me wonder what they’re hiding
[16:39:03] Sidney: i noticed adrian flip from accusing me to drew with zero proof—what’s his angle
[16:39:05] Finley: adrian’s deflecting onto sidney seems as flimsy as sidney’s rush to lynch drew
[16:39:12] Parker: parker: kennedy’s vagueness seems off—anyone else notice that
[16:39:18] Tyler: sidney’s eagerness to vote drew without any evidence seems odd—anyone else feel that
[16:39:20] Drew: why is finley’s call to vote drew fine but sidney’s identical one fishy
[16:39:30] Finley: adrian’s flip from sidney to drew with zero explanation feels way fishy
[16:39:35] Drew: kennedy, you’ve been vague all game—what concrete evidence do you have
[16:39:37] Sidney: kennedy’s dodging details—what’s she hiding
[16:39:40] Adrian: finley’s rush to paint me as a deflector without specifics feels just as fishy—anyone else agree
[16:39:42] Kennedy: parker, where exactly do you find my comments vague
[16:39:43] Tyler: tyler: parker’s rapid target shifts strike me as odd—thoughts
[16:39:58] Finley: why is drew so quick to vote adrian instead of answering any questions

[16:43:13] Finley: parker’s vote for kennedy last round felt random—what was your reasoning
[16:43:21] Tyler: parker’s sudden shift to accusing me with no evidence feels like a diversion
[16:43:31] Parker: tyler, you voted for me last round—what made you pick me
[16:43:38] Kennedy: parker, why did you vote for me last round
[16:43:45] Finley: parker’s shift from kennedy to tyler feels fishy—anyone else notice
[16:43:46] Tyler: i voted you because you’ve been deflecting onto others without any evidence
[16:43:56] Kennedy: finley, you pushed drew hard—why so quiet now
[16:44:06] Parker: i voted kennedy because she went silent right after pushing drew, which felt fishier than any of my shifts
[16:44:31] Finley: kennedy, you voted for sidney last round—what was your read
[16:44:35] Sidney: we’ve just lynched two innocents—what concrete evidence do we have against parker
[16:44:43] Kennedy: parker, why the sudden switch from voting me to accusing tyler—what changed your mind
[16:44:57] Finley: finley: parker, isn’t your sudden shift from kennedy to tyler more suspicious than kennedy’s brief silence
