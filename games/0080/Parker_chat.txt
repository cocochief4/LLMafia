[16:37:10] Parker: hey everyone, any early hunches on who the mafia might be
[16:37:19] Parker: not much yet, but tyler’s silence is making me uneasy
[16:38:09] Parker: sidney’s pushing drew nonstop—does anyone else find that fishy
[16:38:42] Parker: sidney’s eagerness to push a vote seems more suspicious than anything i’ve said
[16:38:57] Parker: finley’s eagerness to nail drew makes me wonder what they’re hiding
[16:39:12] Parker: parker: kennedy’s vagueness seems off—anyone else notice that
[16:42:59] Parker: tyler’s constant finger-pointing without offering his own theory feels suspicious
[16:43:31] Parker: tyler, you voted for me last round—what made you pick me
[16:44:06] Parker: i voted kennedy because she went silent right after pushing drew, which felt fishier than any of my shifts
[16:44:59] Parker: sidney, what evidence points to me as mafia
[16:47:29] Parker: kennedy, what evidence do you have for voting sidney
