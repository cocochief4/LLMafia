[16:37:07] Finley: hey everyone, ready to kick off day 1—anyone strike you as suspicious already
[16:37:16] Finley: morning all, does anyone already have a gut feeling on who to vote today
[16:37:28] Finley: i noticed drew’s been pretty quiet so far—does that strike anyone else as odd
[16:37:52] Finley: drew’s silence really sticks out—should we vote him today
[16:39:05] Finley: adrian’s deflecting onto sidney seems as flimsy as sidney’s rush to lynch drew
[16:39:30] Finley: adrian’s flip from sidney to drew with zero explanation feels way fishy
[16:39:58] Finley: why is drew so quick to vote adrian instead of answering any questions
[16:41:10] Finley: i vote drew for deflecting instead of answering our questions
[16:43:13] Finley: parker’s vote for kennedy last round felt random—what was your reasoning
[16:43:45] Finley: parker’s shift from kennedy to tyler feels fishy—anyone else notice
[16:44:31] Finley: kennedy, you voted for sidney last round—what was your read
[16:44:57] Finley: finley: parker, isn’t your sudden shift from kennedy to tyler more suspicious than kennedy’s brief silence
