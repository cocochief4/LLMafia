[14:29:31] Ari: anyone got a lead
[14:29:32] Frankie: we need a target asap
[14:29:32] Addison: we only got a short time so lets decide fast
[14:29:38] Ari: feel like sam is laying low right now
[14:29:38] Ronny: frankie seems too keen to deflect suspicion
[14:29:42] Addison: im curious why frankie is pushing so hard
[14:29:45] Ronny: im curious why addison is pushing for a quick vote
[14:29:48] Ari: addisons hurry feels suspicious
[14:29:50] Addison: ronny has not said much since calling out frankie
[14:29:51] Frankie: sam is acting fishy staying silent this whole time
[14:29:54] Emerson: WHO IS SAM
[14:29:56] Ronny: rushing this feels off
[14:29:57] Emerson: THERE IS NO SAM IN THIS GAME
[14:30:04] Frankie: ronny been quiet whats your read on this
[14:30:06] Ronny: sam staying quiet right now feels sketchy
[14:30:07] Ari: enough about sam focus on who actually said something suspicious
[14:30:15] Ronny: frankie and addison seem oddly aligned in pushing this vote
[14:30:18] Addison: we need one solid lead before picking on anyone
[14:30:18] Ari: looks like weve been chasing a phantom named sam
[14:30:25] Addison: drop sam and focus on real players
[14:30:31] Frankie: feels like addison is driving this vote feels off vote addison
[14:30:32] Addison: ive noticed emerson speaks a lot but hasnt offered any real clues
[14:30:40] Frankie: someone invented a phantom player feels shady

[14:31:45] Ronny: frankies quiet smirk right now is unsettling
[14:31:54] Ronny: we should vote frankie out
[14:31:57] Frankie: ari sounding way too sure of everything makes me uneasy
[14:31:59] Ari: frankie has been pushing votes could they be secretly mafia
[14:32:13] Ari: i am suspicious of frankies eagerness to shift blame
[14:32:15] Frankie: why not focus on ronny instead of jumping on me
[14:32:28] Ronny: this deflection is suspicious
[14:32:29] Ari: im with ronny frankie deflection feels like mafia play
[14:32:38] Frankie: ari jumping in after ronny feels like a setup
[14:32:38] Ronny: aris laidback attitude about frankie makes me uneasy
[14:32:40] Ari: lets vote ronny out before he can shift blame again
[14:32:49] Frankie: why are ronny and ari so eager to take me down seems odd
[14:32:56] Ari: frankie volunteered to kill ronny last night feels like mafia confession
