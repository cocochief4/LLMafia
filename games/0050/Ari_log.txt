Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status.

[14:30:18] Addison: we need one solid lead before picking on anyone

[14:30:25] Addison: drop sam and focus on real players
[14:30:31] Frankie: feels like addison is driving this vote feels off vote addison

You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time.\nThe rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.\nYou were assigned the following role: bystander.\nThe game's chat room was open at [14:29:22].\nYou can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:\n<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;\n<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.\n\nYou must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens.
