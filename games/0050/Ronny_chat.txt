[14:29:28] Ronny: let us share our first hunch
[14:29:38] Ronny: frankie seems too keen to deflect suspicion
[14:29:45] Ronny: im curious why addison is pushing for a quick vote
[14:29:56] Ronny: rushing this feels off
[14:30:06] Ronny: sam staying quiet right now feels sketchy
[14:30:15] Ronny: frankie and addison seem oddly aligned in pushing this vote
[14:31:45] Ronny: frankies quiet smirk right now is unsettling
[14:31:54] Ronny: we should vote frankie out
[14:32:28] Ronny: this deflection is suspicious
[14:32:38] Ronny: aris laidback attitude about frankie makes me uneasy
[14:33:00] Ronny: dont forget frankie invented sam out of nowhere
[14:33:31] Ronny: they have not shown any proof i am mafia
