[14:34:50] Kennedy: let us kick off our detective work everyone
[14:34:51] Dakota: lets get this town rolling
[14:34:51] Sam: hello everyone ready to find the mafia
[14:34:54] Parker: im looking for odd behavior
[14:34:54] Ray: we should start talking soon
[14:34:58] Sam: i noticed dakota was quiet for a moment
[14:34:59] Dakota: anyone spot odd behavior last night
[14:35:00] Kennedy: who has stayed quiet so far
[14:35:02] Ray: i will watch who stays too quiet
[14:35:03] Parker: lets note any hesitations in replies
[14:35:08] Dakota: i stayed quiet to watch how everyone responds
[14:35:10] Kennedy: parker seems overly active for no reason
[14:35:11] Ray: parker has been quiet more than anyone else
[14:35:14] Parker: dakota was silent then spoke up with no details
[14:35:16] Sam: kennedy chimed in right after dakota that timing feels off
[14:35:19] Ray: sam was quick to pick on dakota
[14:35:21] Sam: lets track parker reply speed to spot inconsistencies
[14:35:22] Kennedy: ray is eager but not sharing any real observations
[14:35:25] Dakota: i find kennedys quick reply a bit fishy
[14:35:28] Sam: rays shifting claims about others silence seems odd
[14:35:30] Parker: sam and ray teaming up seems odd
[14:35:31] Kennedy: ray sided with sam without evidence
[14:35:34] Dakota: i want ray to explain why parker looks suspicious
[14:35:39] Parker: sam and kennedy seem to echo each other too fast
[14:35:40] Kennedy: dakota defended sam way too fast
[14:35:42] Dakota: why did parker shift focus so suddenly
[14:35:42] Ray: dakota seems to avoid specifics when questioned
[14:35:46] Parker: ray can you explain why im suspicious
[14:35:55] Sam: kennedy is pushing claims without mentioning evidence
[14:35:57] Ray: i noticed kennedy only criticized me after sam did
[14:35:59] Parker: ray needs to explain why he was so quick to agree with sam
[14:36:07] Ray: parker keeps demanding proof but offers none
[14:36:08] Sam: kennedy can you give a specific example of suspicious behavior
[14:36:11] Dakota: im curious why sam and kennedy focus so much on ray instead of giving evidence
[14:36:12] Kennedy: sam is bouncing from accusation to accusation without evidence
[14:36:14] Ray: i saw sam typing before dakota posted anything
[14:36:18] Sam: dakota can you explain what you observed last night
[14:36:20] Dakota: kennedy pick a moment when ray slipped up
[14:36:21] Kennedy: sam has been quick to accuse but never explained what they saw
[14:36:27] Parker: sam can you clarify what you saw before dakota responded
[14:36:28] Kennedy: i remember ray said he saw sam typing before dakota posted but he didnt explain why that is suspicious
[14:36:30] Dakota: i saw kennedy hesitate when i asked for details
[14:36:30] Sam: ray show which timestamps back up your point
[14:36:35] Parker: sam still waiting on what you saw last night
[14:36:38] Dakota: ray can you explain what sam was typing before i posted
[14:36:40] Ray: dakota still wont say what they saw last night
[14:36:41] Sam: ray explain why sam typing before dakota posted is suspicious
[14:36:44] Parker: ray post the timestamp you saw sam typing before dakota
