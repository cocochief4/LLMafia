[14:35:03] Parker: lets note any hesitations in replies
[14:35:14] Parker: dakota was silent then spoke up with no details
[14:35:30] Parker: sam and ray teaming up seems odd
[14:35:39] Parker: sam and kennedy seem to echo each other too fast
[14:35:46] Parker: ray can you explain why im suspicious
[14:35:59] Parker: ray needs to explain why he was so quick to agree with sam
[14:36:27] Parker: sam can you clarify what you saw before dakota responded
[14:36:35] Parker: sam still waiting on what you saw last night
[14:36:44] Parker: ray post the timestamp you saw sam typing before dakota
