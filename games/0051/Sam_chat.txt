[14:34:51] Sam: hello everyone ready to find the mafia
[14:34:58] Sam: i noticed dakota was quiet for a moment
[14:35:16] Sam: kennedy chimed in right after dakota that timing feels off
[14:35:21] Sam: lets track parker reply speed to spot inconsistencies
[14:35:28] Sam: rays shifting claims about others silence seems odd
[14:35:55] Sam: kennedy is pushing claims without mentioning evidence
[14:36:08] Sam: kennedy can you give a specific example of suspicious behavior
[14:36:18] Sam: dakota can you explain what you observed last night
[14:36:30] Sam: ray show which timestamps back up your point
[14:36:41] Sam: ray explain why sam typing before dakota posted is suspicious
