[14:34:54] Ray: we should start talking soon
[14:35:02] Ray: i will watch who stays too quiet
[14:35:11] Ray: parker has been quiet more than anyone else
[14:35:19] Ray: sam was quick to pick on dakota
[14:35:42] Ray: dakota seems to avoid specifics when questioned
[14:35:57] Ray: i noticed kennedy only criticized me after sam did
[14:36:07] Ray: parker keeps demanding proof but offers none
[14:36:14] Ray: i saw sam typing before dakota posted anything
[14:36:40] Ray: dakota still wont say what they saw last night
[14:37:17] Ray: that timestamp alone doesnt prove sam is mafia
