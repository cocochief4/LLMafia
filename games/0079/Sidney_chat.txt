[16:13:25] Sidney: hey team, who’s struck you as most suspicious so far
[16:13:35] Sidney: parker’s awfully quiet—does that strike anyone as suspicious
[16:13:56] Sidney: drew, you’ve been awfully quiet—any input
[16:14:20] Sidney: adrian’s been strangely quiet since parker called their drew deflection—anyone else think that’s odd
[16:15:00] Sidney: i’m still uneasy about parker’s sudden apology—what’s behind that quick switch
[16:15:23] Sidney: your pivot from accusing drew to blaming adrian had no real reasoning and feels fishy
[16:17:15] Sidney: i’m voting parker—still no evidence to back their claims
[16:18:26] Sidney: i’m with finley—let’s kill drew
[16:19:18] Sidney: adrian’s quiet streak is getting shady—care to defend yourself
[16:20:15] Sidney: i’m voting adrian because their sudden shift from silence to defensiveness feels forced
