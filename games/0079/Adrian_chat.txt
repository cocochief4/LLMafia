[16:13:25] Adrian: anyone have a gut feeling on who might be mafia
[16:13:32] Adrian: i haven’t heard much from drew—anyone else think that’s suspicious
[16:14:12] Adrian: let’s hear from drew before we lock in any votes
[16:14:31] Adrian: parker, what changed that makes you suddenly suspect drew
[16:14:53] Adrian: should we question parker about their deflection before going after drew
[16:15:49] Adrian: parker’s back-and-forth looks worse than drew’s silence
[16:18:30] Adrian: who pushed hardest on parker’s and drew’s lynches and why
[16:18:50] Adrian: sorry for the silence—tyler’s sudden defensiveness feels most suspicious
[16:19:28] Adrian: i’m voting tyler—his sudden defensiveness and silence feel mafia
[16:19:51] Adrian: i’ve been pushing tyler the whole game—why pivot to me now, sidney
[16:20:36] Adrian: sidney, where is your vote going—me or tyler
