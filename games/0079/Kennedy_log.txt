Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

[16:13:35] Sidney: parkerâ€™s awfully quietâ€”does that strike anyone as suspicious
Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

[16:13:14] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:13:24] Finley: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who to vote out
[16:13:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, any early thoughts on who might be mafia
[16:13:25] Adrian: anyone have a gut feeling on who might be mafia
[16:13:25] Sidney: hey team, whoâ€™s struck you as most suspicious so far
[16:13:26] Parker: alright everyone, letâ€™s dive inâ€”any initial suspects
[16:13:26] Tyler: hi folks, happy to be hereâ€”any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[16:13:28] Drew: with only three minutes on the clock, letâ€™s get any suspicions out in the open quickly
[16:13:32] Adrian: i havenâ€™t heard much from drewâ€”anyone else think thatâ€™s suspicious
[16:13:35] Sidney: parkerâ€™s awfully quietâ€”does that strike anyone as suspicious
[16:13:36] Kennedy: i'm a bit suspicious of parker since they've been really quiet so far
[16:13:37] Parker: drewâ€™s been pretty quiet so farâ€”anyone else find that odd
[16:13:37] Tyler: drewâ€™s been strangely quietâ€”drew, what are your thoughts
[16:13:50] Parker: sorry for being quiet, but adrianâ€™s sudden focus on drew feels like deflection
[16:13:52] Drew: finley and kennedy jumped in firstâ€”anyone else find that suspicious
[16:13:53] Tyler: is parkerâ€™s quick deflection to drew more suspicious than drewâ€™s silence
[16:13:56] Finley: iâ€™m leaning towards drew because theyâ€™ve been way too quiet
[16:13:56] Sidney: drew, youâ€™ve been awfully quietâ€”any input
[16:14:09] Kennedy: parkerâ€™s ghosting us this round feels like a big red flag
[16:14:12] Adrian: letâ€™s hear from drew before we lock in any votes
[16:14:14] Drew: adrianâ€™s sudden focus on me without any real evidence feels like deflection
[16:14:20] Sidney: adrianâ€™s been strangely quiet since parker called their drew deflectionâ€”anyone else think thatâ€™s odd
[16:14:22] Kennedy: i feel like weâ€™re jumping on drew just because theyâ€™re quiet
[16:14:26] Drew: i think parkerâ€™s deflection of blame is more suspicious than my silence
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

[16:14:48] Tyler: parker, why the sudden flip from deflecting onto drew to apologizing now
[16:14:53] Adrian: should we question parker about their deflection before going after drew
[16:14:55] Parker: sidney, youâ€™ve been pointing fingers without proofâ€”whatâ€™s your reasoning

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

[16:13:14] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:13:24] Finley: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who to vote out
[16:13:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, any early thoughts on who might be mafia
[16:13:25] Adrian: anyone have a gut feeling on who might be mafia
[16:13:25] Sidney: hey team, whoâ€™s struck you as most suspicious so far
[16:13:26] Parker: alright everyone, letâ€™s dive inâ€”any initial suspects
[16:13:26] Tyler: hi folks, happy to be hereâ€”any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[16:13:28] Drew: with only three minutes on the clock, letâ€™s get any suspicions out in the open quickly
[16:13:32] Adrian: i havenâ€™t heard much from drewâ€”anyone else think thatâ€™s suspicious
[16:13:35] Sidney: parkerâ€™s awfully quietâ€”does that strike anyone as suspicious
[16:13:36] Kennedy: i'm a bit suspicious of parker since they've been really quiet so far
[16:13:37] Parker: drewâ€™s been pretty quiet so farâ€”anyone else find that odd
[16:13:37] Tyler: drewâ€™s been strangely quietâ€”drew, what are your thoughts
[16:13:50] Parker: sorry for being quiet, but adrianâ€™s sudden focus on drew feels like deflection
[16:13:52] Drew: finley and kennedy jumped in firstâ€”anyone else find that suspicious
[16:13:53] Tyler: is parkerâ€™s quick deflection to drew more suspicious than drewâ€™s silence
[16:13:56] Finley: iâ€™m leaning towards drew because theyâ€™ve been way too quiet
[16:13:56] Sidney: drew, youâ€™ve been awfully quietâ€”any input
[16:14:09] Kennedy: parkerâ€™s ghosting us this round feels like a big red flag
[16:14:12] Adrian: letâ€™s hear from drew before we lock in any votes
[16:14:14] Drew: adrianâ€™s sudden focus on me without any real evidence feels like deflection

[16:14:22] Kennedy: i feel like weâ€™re jumping on drew just because theyâ€™re quiet
[16:14:26] Drew: i think parkerâ€™s deflection of blame is more suspicious than my silence
[16:14:31] Adrian: parker, what changed that makes you suddenly suspect drew
[16:14:33] Finley: iâ€™m with tylerâ€”parkerâ€™s quick flip from deflecting to apologizing seems way too calculated
[16:14:48] Tyler: parker, why the sudden flip from deflecting onto drew to apologizing now
[16:14:53] Adrian: should we question parker about their deflection before going after drew
[16:14:55] Parker: sidney, youâ€™ve been pointing fingers without proofâ€”whatâ€™s your reasoning

[16:15:00] Sidney: iâ€™m still uneasy about parkerâ€™s sudden apologyâ€”whatâ€™s behind that quick switch
[16:15:10] Finley: if parker canâ€™t explain that flip, theyâ€™re getting my vote

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:13:14].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker unknown
 Drew unknown
 Finley unknown
 Tyler unknown
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

[16:13:14] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:13:24] Finley: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who to vote out
[16:13:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, any early thoughts on who might be mafia
[16:13:25] Adrian: anyone have a gut feeling on who might be mafia
[16:13:25] Sidney: hey team, whoâ€™s struck you as most suspicious so far
[16:13:26] Parker: alright everyone, letâ€™s dive inâ€”any initial suspects
[16:13:26] Tyler: hi folks, happy to be hereâ€”any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[16:13:28] Drew: with only three minutes on the clock, letâ€™s get any suspicions out in the open quickly
[16:13:32] Adrian: i havenâ€™t heard much from drewâ€”anyone else think thatâ€™s suspicious
[16:13:35] Sidney: parkerâ€™s awfully quietâ€”does that strike anyone as suspicious
[16:13:36] Kennedy: i'm a bit suspicious of parker since they've been really quiet so far
[16:13:37] Parker: drewâ€™s been pretty quiet so farâ€”anyone else find that odd
[16:13:37] Tyler: drewâ€™s been strangely quietâ€”drew, what are your thoughts
[16:13:50] Parker: sorry for being quiet, but adrianâ€™s sudden focus on drew feels like deflection
[16:13:52] Drew: finley and kennedy jumped in firstâ€”anyone else find that suspicious
[16:13:53] Tyler: is parkerâ€™s quick deflection to drew more suspicious than drewâ€™s silence
[16:13:56] Finley: iâ€™m leaning towards drew because theyâ€™ve been way too quiet
[16:13:56] Sidney: drew, youâ€™ve been awfully quietâ€”any input
[16:14:09] Kennedy: parkerâ€™s ghosting us this round feels like a big red flag
[16:14:12] Adrian: letâ€™s hear from drew before we lock in any votes
[16:14:14] Drew: adrianâ€™s sudden focus on me without any real evidence feels like deflection
[16:14:20] Sidney: adrianâ€™s been strangely quiet since parker called their drew deflectionâ€”anyone else think thatâ€™s odd
[16:14:22] Kennedy: i feel like weâ€™re jumping on drew just because theyâ€™re quiet
[16:14:26] Drew: i think parkerâ€™s deflection of blame is more suspicious than my silence
[16:14:31] Adrian: parker, what changed that makes you suddenly suspect drew
[16:14:33] Finley: iâ€™m with tylerâ€”parkerâ€™s quick flip from deflecting to apologizing seems way too calculated
[16:14:48] Tyler: parker, why the sudden flip from deflecting onto drew to apologizing now
[16:14:53] Adrian: should we question parker about their deflection before going after drew
[16:14:55] Parker: sidney, youâ€™ve been pointing fingers without proofâ€”whatâ€™s your reasoning
[16:14:55] Drew: anyone else find parkerâ€™s sudden flip from accusing me to blaming adrian suspicious
[16:15:00] Sidney: iâ€™m still uneasy about parkerâ€™s sudden apologyâ€”whatâ€™s behind that quick switch
[16:15:10] Finley: if parker canâ€™t explain that flip, theyâ€™re getting my vote
[16:15:10] Tyler: drewâ€™s repeated accusations feel more like projection than real evidence
[16:15:11] Parker: good callâ€”my deflection was hasty, letâ€™s pause and hear drew out first
[16:15:21] Kennedy: parker, can you provide any solid evidence for your new suspicion of adrian
[16:15:23] Sidney: your pivot from accusing drew to blaming adrian had no real reasoning and feels fishy
[16:15:28] Finley: iâ€™m not comfortable voting out parker on a hunchâ€”what real evidence is there
[16:15:34] Parker: tyler, what exactly makes you see drewâ€™s accusations as projection
[16:15:39] Drew: parker, what evidence made you backtrack so quickly
[16:15:40] Tyler: parker, is that apology just a stall tactic
[16:15:48] Parker: adrian defended drew without questioning my explanation, which feels like mafia coordination
[16:15:49] Adrian: parkerâ€™s back-and-forth looks worse than drewâ€™s silence
[16:15:54] Kennedy: parker, if you canâ€™t provide real evidence against adrian then this pivot ends now

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[16:13:14] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:13:24] Finley: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who to vote out
[16:13:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, any early thoughts on who might be mafia
[16:13:25] Adrian: anyone have a gut feeling on who might be mafia
[16:13:25] Sidney: hey team, whoâ€™s struck you as most suspicious so far
[16:13:26] Parker: alright everyone, letâ€™s dive inâ€”any initial suspects
[16:13:26] Tyler: hi folks, happy to be hereâ€”any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[16:13:28] Drew: with only three minutes on the clock, letâ€™s get any suspicions out in the open quickly
[16:13:32] Adrian: i havenâ€™t heard much from drewâ€”anyone else think thatâ€™s suspicious
[16:13:35] Sidney: parkerâ€™s awfully quietâ€”does that strike anyone as suspicious
[16:13:36] Kennedy: i'm a bit suspicious of parker since they've been really quiet so far
[16:13:37] Parker: drewâ€™s been pretty quiet so farâ€”anyone else find that odd
[16:13:37] Tyler: drewâ€™s been strangely quietâ€”drew, what are your thoughts
[16:13:50] Parker: sorry for being quiet, but adrianâ€™s sudden focus on drew feels like deflection
[16:13:52] Drew: finley and kennedy jumped in firstâ€”anyone else find that suspicious
[16:13:53] Tyler: is parkerâ€™s quick deflection to drew more suspicious than drewâ€™s silence
[16:13:56] Finley: iâ€™m leaning towards drew because theyâ€™ve been way too quiet
[16:13:56] Sidney: drew, youâ€™ve been awfully quietâ€”any input
[16:14:09] Kennedy: parkerâ€™s ghosting us this round feels like a big red flag
[16:14:12] Adrian: letâ€™s hear from drew before we lock in any votes
[16:14:14] Drew: adrianâ€™s sudden focus on me without any real evidence feels like deflection
[16:14:20] Sidney: adrianâ€™s been strangely quiet since parker called their drew deflectionâ€”anyone else think thatâ€™s odd
[16:14:22] Kennedy: i feel like weâ€™re jumping on drew just because theyâ€™re quiet
[16:14:26] Drew: i think parkerâ€™s deflection of blame is more suspicious than my silence
[16:14:31] Adrian: parker, what changed that makes you suddenly suspect drew
[16:14:33] Finley: iâ€™m with tylerâ€”parkerâ€™s quick flip from deflecting to apologizing seems way too calculated
[16:14:48] Tyler: parker, why the sudden flip from deflecting onto drew to apologizing now
[16:14:53] Adrian: should we question parker about their deflection before going after drew
[16:14:55] Parker: sidney, youâ€™ve been pointing fingers without proofâ€”whatâ€™s your reasoning
[16:14:55] Drew: anyone else find parkerâ€™s sudden flip from accusing me to blaming adrian suspicious
[16:15:00] Sidney: iâ€™m still uneasy about parkerâ€™s sudden apologyâ€”whatâ€™s behind that quick switch
[16:15:10] Finley: if parker canâ€™t explain that flip, theyâ€™re getting my vote
[16:15:10] Tyler: drewâ€™s repeated accusations feel more like projection than real evidence
[16:15:11] Parker: good callâ€”my deflection was hasty, letâ€™s pause and hear drew out first
[16:15:21] Kennedy: parker, can you provide any solid evidence for your new suspicion of adrian
[16:15:23] Sidney: your pivot from accusing drew to blaming adrian had no real reasoning and feels fishy
[16:15:28] Finley: iâ€™m not comfortable voting out parker on a hunchâ€”what real evidence is there
[16:15:34] Parker: tyler, what exactly makes you see drewâ€™s accusations as projection
[16:15:39] Drew: parker, what evidence made you backtrack so quickly
[16:15:40] Tyler: parker, is that apology just a stall tactic
[16:15:48] Parker: adrian defended drew without questioning my explanation, which feels like mafia coordination
[16:15:49] Adrian: parkerâ€™s back-and-forth looks worse than drewâ€™s silence
[16:15:54] Kennedy: parker, if you canâ€™t provide real evidence against adrian then this pivot ends now
[16:15:58] Tyler: parker, whatâ€™s your reasoning for pivoting to adrian without offering any proof
[16:16:00] Parker: tyler, iâ€™m not stallingâ€”iâ€™m steering us toward real evidence, not just hunches
[16:16:02] Finley: iâ€™m done waitingâ€”parker has to give proof or they get my vote
[16:16:02] Drew: tyler, what specific example of projection are you referring to
[16:16:14] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:16:45] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[16:16:45] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:16:23] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Adrian
[16:16:24] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[16:16:28] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[16:16:33] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[16:16:36] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[16:16:40] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[16:16:45] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[16:18:01] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[16:18:01] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:18:16] Kennedy: adrian was oddly silent as we wrongly lynched two bystandersâ€”why so quiet
[16:18:26] Sidney: iâ€™m with finleyâ€”letâ€™s kill drew
[16:18:30] Adrian: who pushed hardest on parkerâ€™s and drewâ€™s lynches and why
Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

[16:13:56] Sidney: drew, youâ€™ve been awfully quietâ€”any input
[16:14:09] Kennedy: parkerâ€™s ghosting us this round feels like a big red flag
[16:14:12] Adrian: letâ€™s hear from drew before we lock in any votes
[16:14:14] Drew: adrianâ€™s sudden focus on me without any real evidence feels like deflection
[16:14:20] Sidney: adrianâ€™s been strangely quiet since parker called their drew deflectionâ€”anyone else think thatâ€™s odd
[16:14:22] Kennedy: i feel like weâ€™re jumping on drew just because theyâ€™re quiet
[16:14:26] Drew: i think parkerâ€™s deflection of blame is more suspicious than my silence
[16:14:31] Adrian: parker, what changed that makes you suddenly suspect drew
[16:14:33] Finley: iâ€™m with tylerâ€”parkerâ€™s quick flip from deflecting to apologizing seems way too calculated
[16:14:48] Tyler: parker, why the sudden flip from deflecting onto drew to apologizing now
[16:14:53] Adrian: should we question parker about their deflection before going after drew
[16:14:55] Parker: sidney, youâ€™ve been pointing fingers without proofâ€”whatâ€™s your reasoning
[16:14:55] Drew: anyone else find parkerâ€™s sudden flip from accusing me to blaming adrian suspicious
[16:15:00] Sidney: iâ€™m still uneasy about parkerâ€™s sudden apologyâ€”whatâ€™s behind that quick switch
[16:15:10] Finley: if parker canâ€™t explain that flip, theyâ€™re getting my vote
[16:15:10] Tyler: drewâ€™s repeated accusations feel more like projection than real evidence
[16:15:11] Parker: good callâ€”my deflection was hasty, letâ€™s pause and hear drew out first
[16:15:21] Kennedy: parker, can you provide any solid evidence for your new suspicion of adrian
[16:15:23] Sidney: your pivot from accusing drew to blaming adrian had no real reasoning and feels fishy
[16:15:28] Finley: iâ€™m not comfortable voting out parker on a hunchâ€”what real evidence is there
[16:15:34] Parker: tyler, what exactly makes you see drewâ€™s accusations as projection
[16:15:39] Drew: parker, what evidence made you backtrack so quickly
[16:15:40] Tyler: parker, is that apology just a stall tactic
[16:15:48] Parker: adrian defended drew without questioning my explanation, which feels like mafia coordination
[16:15:49] Adrian: parkerâ€™s back-and-forth looks worse than drewâ€™s silence
[16:15:54] Kennedy: parker, if you canâ€™t provide real evidence against adrian then this pivot ends now
[16:15:58] Tyler: parker, whatâ€™s your reasoning for pivoting to adrian without offering any proof
[16:16:00] Parker: tyler, iâ€™m not stallingâ€”iâ€™m steering us toward real evidence, not just hunches
[16:16:02] Finley: iâ€™m done waitingâ€”parker has to give proof or they get my vote
[16:16:02] Drew: tyler, what specific example of projection are you referring to
[16:16:14] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:16:45] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[16:16:45] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:16:23] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Adrian
[16:16:24] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[16:16:28] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[16:16:33] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker

[16:18:01] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[16:18:01] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:18:16] Kennedy: adrian was oddly silent as we wrongly lynched two bystandersâ€”why so quiet
[16:18:26] Sidney: iâ€™m with finleyâ€”letâ€™s kill drew
[16:18:30] Adrian: who pushed hardest on parkerâ€™s and drewâ€™s lynches and why
[16:18:37] Kennedy: two innocents downâ€”letâ€™s only vote on solid leads
[16:18:50] Adrian: sorry for the silenceâ€”tylerâ€™s sudden defensiveness feels most suspicious
[16:18:54] Finley: iâ€™m going with adrian because theyâ€™ve been too vocal
Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

[16:18:26] Sidney: iâ€™m with finleyâ€”letâ€™s kill drew
[16:18:30] Adrian: who pushed hardest on parkerâ€™s and drewâ€™s lynches and why
[16:18:37] Kennedy: two innocents downâ€”letâ€™s only vote on solid leads
[16:18:50] Adrian: sorry for the silenceâ€”tylerâ€™s sudden defensiveness feels most suspicious
[16:18:54] Finley: iâ€™m going with adrian because theyâ€™ve been too vocal
[16:19:07] Kennedy: sidneyâ€”drewâ€™s already dead, whoâ€™s your real target
[16:19:18] Sidney: adrianâ€™s quiet streak is getting shadyâ€”care to defend yourself

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

[16:13:50] Parker: sorry for being quiet, but adrianâ€™s sudden focus on drew feels like deflection
[16:13:52] Drew: finley and kennedy jumped in firstâ€”anyone else find that suspicious
[16:13:53] Tyler: is parkerâ€™s quick deflection to drew more suspicious than drewâ€™s silence

Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

[16:18:01] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:18:16] Kennedy: adrian was oddly silent as we wrongly lynched two bystandersâ€”why so quiet

[16:18:30] Adrian: who pushed hardest on parkerâ€™s and drewâ€™s lynches and why

[16:19:07] Kennedy: sidneyâ€”drewâ€™s already dead, whoâ€™s your real target
[16:19:18] Sidney: adrianâ€™s quiet streak is getting shadyâ€”care to defend yourself
[16:19:28] Adrian: iâ€™m voting tylerâ€”his sudden defensiveness and silence feel mafia
[16:19:43] Kennedy: finley, why is adrian being vocal enough evidence to vote them out
[16:19:51] Adrian: iâ€™ve been pushing tyler the whole gameâ€”why pivot to me now, sidney
[16:19:51] Finley: iâ€™m voting tylerâ€”his sudden defensiveness feels like a smokescreen
[16:20:02] Tyler: finleyâ€™s rush to vote without evidence feels as suspicious as adrianâ€™s silence
[16:20:15] Sidney: iâ€™m voting adrian because their sudden shift from silence to defensiveness feels forced
Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

[16:13:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, any early thoughts on who might be mafia
[16:13:25] Adrian: anyone have a gut feeling on who might be mafia
[16:13:25] Sidney: hey team, whoâ€™s struck you as most suspicious so far
[16:13:26] Parker: alright everyone, letâ€™s dive inâ€”any initial suspects
[16:13:26] Tyler: hi folks, happy to be hereâ€”any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[16:13:28] Drew: with only three minutes on the clock, letâ€™s get any suspicions out in the open quickly
[16:13:32] Adrian: i havenâ€™t heard much from drewâ€”anyone else think thatâ€™s suspicious
[16:13:35] Sidney: parkerâ€™s awfully quietâ€”does that strike anyone as suspicious
[16:13:36] Kennedy: i'm a bit suspicious of parker since they've been really quiet so far
[16:13:37] Parker: drewâ€™s been pretty quiet so farâ€”anyone else find that odd
[16:13:37] Tyler: drewâ€™s been strangely quietâ€”drew, what are your thoughts
[16:13:50] Parker: sorry for being quiet, but adrianâ€™s sudden focus on drew feels like deflection
[16:13:52] Drew: finley and kennedy jumped in firstâ€”anyone else find that suspicious
[16:13:53] Tyler: is parkerâ€™s quick deflection to drew more suspicious than drewâ€™s silence
[16:13:56] Finley: iâ€™m leaning towards drew because theyâ€™ve been way too quiet
[16:13:56] Sidney: drew, youâ€™ve been awfully quietâ€”any input
[16:14:09] Kennedy: parkerâ€™s ghosting us this round feels like a big red flag
[16:14:12] Adrian: letâ€™s hear from drew before we lock in any votes
[16:14:14] Drew: adrianâ€™s sudden focus on me without any real evidence feels like deflection
[16:14:20] Sidney: adrianâ€™s been strangely quiet since parker called their drew deflectionâ€”anyone else think thatâ€™s odd
[16:14:22] Kennedy: i feel like weâ€™re jumping on drew just because theyâ€™re quiet
[16:14:26] Drew: i think parkerâ€™s deflection of blame is more suspicious than my silence
[16:14:31] Adrian: parker, what changed that makes you suddenly suspect drew
[16:14:33] Finley: iâ€™m with tylerâ€”parkerâ€™s quick flip from deflecting to apologizing seems way too calculated

[16:14:53] Adrian: should we question parker about their deflection before going after drew
[16:14:55] Parker: sidney, youâ€™ve been pointing fingers without proofâ€”whatâ€™s your reasoning

[16:15:00] Sidney: iâ€™m still uneasy about parkerâ€™s sudden apologyâ€”whatâ€™s behind that quick switch
[16:15:10] Finley: if parker canâ€™t explain that flip, theyâ€™re getting my vote
[16:15:10] Tyler: drewâ€™s repeated accusations feel more like projection than real evidence
[16:15:11] Parker: good callâ€”my deflection was hasty, letâ€™s pause and hear drew out first

[16:19:07] Kennedy: sidneyâ€”drewâ€™s already dead, whoâ€™s your real target
[16:19:18] Sidney: adrianâ€™s quiet streak is getting shadyâ€”care to defend yourself

[16:20:15] Sidney: iâ€™m voting adrian because their sudden shift from silence to defensiveness feels forced
[16:20:27] Kennedy: tylerâ€™s radio silence after adrianâ€™s accusations is looking shadyâ€”care to defend yourself
[16:20:31] Tyler: finley, what specific evidence made you flip from adrian to me
[16:20:33] Finley: adrianâ€™s frantic pivot to tyler feels like a panic play, not genuine suspicion

[16:13:26] Tyler: hi folks, happy to be hereâ€”any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[16:13:28] Drew: with only three minutes on the clock, letâ€™s get any suspicions out in the open quickly
[16:13:32] Adrian: i havenâ€™t heard much from drewâ€”anyone else think thatâ€™s suspicious
[16:13:35] Sidney: parkerâ€™s awfully quietâ€”does that strike anyone as suspicious
[16:13:36] Kennedy: i'm a bit suspicious of parker since they've been really quiet so far
[16:13:37] Parker: drewâ€™s been pretty quiet so farâ€”anyone else find that odd
[16:13:37] Tyler: drewâ€™s been strangely quietâ€”drew, what are your thoughts
[16:13:50] Parker: sorry for being quiet, but adrianâ€™s sudden focus on drew feels like deflection
[16:13:52] Drew: finley and kennedy jumped in firstâ€”anyone else find that suspicious
[16:13:53] Tyler: is parkerâ€™s quick deflection to drew more suspicious than drewâ€™s silence
[16:13:56] Finley: iâ€™m leaning towards drew because theyâ€™ve been way too quiet
[16:13:56] Sidney: drew, youâ€™ve been awfully quietâ€”any input
[16:14:09] Kennedy: parkerâ€™s ghosting us this round feels like a big red flag
[16:14:12] Adrian: letâ€™s hear from drew before we lock in any votes
[16:14:14] Drew: adrianâ€™s sudden focus on me without any real evidence feels like deflection
[16:14:20] Sidney: adrianâ€™s been strangely quiet since parker called their drew deflectionâ€”anyone else think thatâ€™s odd
[16:14:22] Kennedy: i feel like weâ€™re jumping on drew just because theyâ€™re quiet
[16:14:26] Drew: i think parkerâ€™s deflection of blame is more suspicious than my silence
[16:14:31] Adrian: parker, what changed that makes you suddenly suspect drew
[16:14:33] Finley: iâ€™m with tylerâ€”parkerâ€™s quick flip from deflecting to apologizing seems way too calculated
[16:14:48] Tyler: parker, why the sudden flip from deflecting onto drew to apologizing now
[16:14:53] Adrian: should we question parker about their deflection before going after drew
[16:14:55] Parker: sidney, youâ€™ve been pointing fingers without proofâ€”whatâ€™s your reasoning
[16:14:55] Drew: anyone else find parkerâ€™s sudden flip from accusing me to blaming adrian suspicious

[16:15:39] Drew: parker, what evidence made you backtrack so quickly
[16:15:40] Tyler: parker, is that apology just a stall tactic
[16:15:48] Parker: adrian defended drew without questioning my explanation, which feels like mafia coordination

[16:16:00] Parker: tyler, iâ€™m not stallingâ€”iâ€™m steering us toward real evidence, not just hunches
[16:16:02] Finley: iâ€™m done waitingâ€”parker has to give proof or they get my vote

## CONTENT: Your name is Kennedy.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:13:14].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian unknown
 Sidney unknown
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Finley unknown
 Tyler unknown
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

[16:18:01] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:18:16] Kennedy: adrian was oddly silent as we wrongly lynched two bystandersâ€”why so quiet
[16:18:26] Sidney: iâ€™m with finleyâ€”letâ€™s kill drew
[16:18:30] Adrian: who pushed hardest on parkerâ€™s and drewâ€™s lynches and why
[16:18:37] Kennedy: two innocents downâ€”letâ€™s only vote on solid leads
[16:18:50] Adrian: sorry for the silenceâ€”tylerâ€™s sudden defensiveness feels most suspicious

[16:19:07] Kennedy: sidneyâ€”drewâ€™s already dead, whoâ€™s your real target
[16:19:18] Sidney: adrianâ€™s quiet streak is getting shadyâ€”care to defend yourself

[16:19:43] Kennedy: finley, why is adrian being vocal enough evidence to vote them out
[16:19:51] Adrian: iâ€™ve been pushing tyler the whole gameâ€”why pivot to me now, sidney
[16:19:51] Finley: iâ€™m voting tylerâ€”his sudden defensiveness feels like a smokescreen
[16:20:02] Tyler: finleyâ€™s rush to vote without evidence feels as suspicious as adrianâ€™s silence
[16:20:15] Sidney: iâ€™m voting adrian because their sudden shift from silence to defensiveness feels forced
[16:20:27] Kennedy: tylerâ€™s radio silence after adrianâ€™s accusations is looking shadyâ€”care to defend yourself
[16:20:31] Tyler: finley, what specific evidence made you flip from adrian to me
[16:20:33] Finley: adrianâ€™s frantic pivot to tyler feels like a panic play, not genuine suspicion
[16:20:36] Adrian: sidney, where is your vote goingâ€”me or tyler
[16:20:48] Tyler: kennedy, what solid evidence do you have against me
[16:20:54] Kennedy: sidney, what exact moment made adrianâ€™s defensiveness feel forced
