[16:13:26] Tyler: hi folks, happy to be here—any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[16:13:37] Tyler: drew’s been strangely quiet—drew, what are your thoughts
[16:13:53] Tyler: is parker’s quick deflection to drew more suspicious than drew’s silence
[16:14:48] Tyler: parker, why the sudden flip from deflecting onto drew to apologizing now
[16:15:10] Tyler: drew’s repeated accusations feel more like projection than real evidence
[16:15:40] Tyler: parker, is that apology just a stall tactic
[16:15:58] Tyler: parker, what’s your reasoning for pivoting to adrian without offering any proof
[16:20:02] Tyler: finley’s rush to vote without evidence feels as suspicious as adrian’s silence
[16:20:31] Tyler: finley, what specific evidence made you flip from adrian to me
[16:20:48] Tyler: kennedy, what solid evidence do you have against me
