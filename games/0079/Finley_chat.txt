[16:13:24] Finley: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who to vote out
[16:13:56] Finley: i’m leaning towards drew because they’ve been way too quiet
[16:14:33] Finley: i’m with tyler—parker’s quick flip from deflecting to apologizing seems way too calculated
[16:15:10] Finley: if parker can’t explain that flip, they’re getting my vote
[16:15:28] Finley: i’m not comfortable voting out parker on a hunch—what real evidence is there
[16:16:02] Finley: i’m done waiting—parker has to give proof or they get my vote
[16:18:54] Finley: i’m going with adrian because they’ve been too vocal
[16:19:51] Finley: i’m voting tyler—his sudden defensiveness feels like a smokescreen
[16:20:33] Finley: adrian’s frantic pivot to tyler feels like a panic play, not genuine suspicion
