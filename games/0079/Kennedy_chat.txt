[16:13:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, any early thoughts on who might be mafia
[16:13:36] Kennedy: i'm a bit suspicious of parker since they've been really quiet so far
[16:14:09] Kennedy: parker’s ghosting us this round feels like a big red flag
[16:14:22] Kennedy: i feel like we’re jumping on drew just because they’re quiet
[16:15:21] Kennedy: parker, can you provide any solid evidence for your new suspicion of adrian
[16:15:54] Kennedy: parker, if you can’t provide real evidence against adrian then this pivot ends now
[16:18:16] Kennedy: adrian was oddly silent as we wrongly lynched two bystanders—why so quiet
[16:18:37] Kennedy: two innocents down—let’s only vote on solid leads
[16:19:07] Kennedy: sidney—drew’s already dead, who’s your real target
[16:19:43] Kennedy: finley, why is adrian being vocal enough evidence to vote them out
[16:20:27] Kennedy: tyler’s radio silence after adrian’s accusations is looking shady—care to defend yourself
[16:20:54] Kennedy: sidney, what exact moment made adrian’s defensiveness feel forced
[16:22:15] Kennedy: tyler, why did you vote adrian after defending yourself so hard
