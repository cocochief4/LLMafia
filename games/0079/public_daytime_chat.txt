[16:13:24] Finley: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who to vote out
[16:13:24] Kennedy: hey everyone, any early thoughts on who might be mafia
[16:13:25] Adrian: anyone have a gut feeling on who might be mafia
[16:13:25] Sidney: hey team, who’s struck you as most suspicious so far
[16:13:26] Parker: alright everyone, let’s dive in—any initial suspects
[16:13:26] Tyler: hi folks, happy to be here—any initial suspicions on who might be mafia
[16:13:28] Drew: with only three minutes on the clock, let’s get any suspicions out in the open quickly
[16:13:32] Adrian: i haven’t heard much from drew—anyone else think that’s suspicious
[16:13:35] Sidney: parker’s awfully quiet—does that strike anyone as suspicious
[16:13:36] Kennedy: i'm a bit suspicious of parker since they've been really quiet so far
[16:13:37] Parker: drew’s been pretty quiet so far—anyone else find that odd
[16:13:37] Tyler: drew’s been strangely quiet—drew, what are your thoughts
[16:13:50] Parker: sorry for being quiet, but adrian’s sudden focus on drew feels like deflection
[16:13:52] Drew: finley and kennedy jumped in first—anyone else find that suspicious
[16:13:53] Tyler: is parker’s quick deflection to drew more suspicious than drew’s silence
[16:13:56] Finley: i’m leaning towards drew because they’ve been way too quiet
[16:13:56] Sidney: drew, you’ve been awfully quiet—any input
[16:14:09] Kennedy: parker’s ghosting us this round feels like a big red flag
[16:14:12] Adrian: let’s hear from drew before we lock in any votes
[16:14:14] Drew: adrian’s sudden focus on me without any real evidence feels like deflection
[16:14:20] Sidney: adrian’s been strangely quiet since parker called their drew deflection—anyone else think that’s odd
[16:14:22] Kennedy: i feel like we’re jumping on drew just because they’re quiet
[16:14:26] Drew: i think parker’s deflection of blame is more suspicious than my silence
[16:14:31] Adrian: parker, what changed that makes you suddenly suspect drew
[16:14:33] Finley: i’m with tyler—parker’s quick flip from deflecting to apologizing seems way too calculated
[16:14:48] Tyler: parker, why the sudden flip from deflecting onto drew to apologizing now
[16:14:53] Adrian: should we question parker about their deflection before going after drew
[16:14:55] Parker: sidney, you’ve been pointing fingers without proof—what’s your reasoning
[16:14:55] Drew: anyone else find parker’s sudden flip from accusing me to blaming adrian suspicious
[16:15:00] Sidney: i’m still uneasy about parker’s sudden apology—what’s behind that quick switch
[16:15:10] Finley: if parker can’t explain that flip, they’re getting my vote
[16:15:10] Tyler: drew’s repeated accusations feel more like projection than real evidence
[16:15:11] Parker: good call—my deflection was hasty, let’s pause and hear drew out first
[16:15:21] Kennedy: parker, can you provide any solid evidence for your new suspicion of adrian
[16:15:23] Sidney: your pivot from accusing drew to blaming adrian had no real reasoning and feels fishy
[16:15:28] Finley: i’m not comfortable voting out parker on a hunch—what real evidence is there
[16:15:34] Parker: tyler, what exactly makes you see drew’s accusations as projection
[16:15:39] Drew: parker, what evidence made you backtrack so quickly
[16:15:40] Tyler: parker, is that apology just a stall tactic
[16:15:48] Parker: adrian defended drew without questioning my explanation, which feels like mafia coordination
[16:15:49] Adrian: parker’s back-and-forth looks worse than drew’s silence
[16:15:54] Kennedy: parker, if you can’t provide real evidence against adrian then this pivot ends now
[16:15:58] Tyler: parker, what’s your reasoning for pivoting to adrian without offering any proof
[16:16:00] Parker: tyler, i’m not stalling—i’m steering us toward real evidence, not just hunches
[16:16:02] Finley: i’m done waiting—parker has to give proof or they get my vote
[16:16:02] Drew: tyler, what specific example of projection are you referring to
[16:16:14] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

[16:18:16] Kennedy: adrian was oddly silent as we wrongly lynched two bystanders—why so quiet
[16:18:26] Sidney: i’m with finley—let’s kill drew
[16:18:30] Adrian: who pushed hardest on parker’s and drew’s lynches and why
[16:18:37] Kennedy: two innocents down—let’s only vote on solid leads
[16:18:50] Adrian: sorry for the silence—tyler’s sudden defensiveness feels most suspicious
[16:18:54] Finley: i’m going with adrian because they’ve been too vocal
[16:19:07] Kennedy: sidney—drew’s already dead, who’s your real target
[16:19:18] Sidney: adrian’s quiet streak is getting shady—care to defend yourself
[16:19:28] Adrian: i’m voting tyler—his sudden defensiveness and silence feel mafia
[16:19:43] Kennedy: finley, why is adrian being vocal enough evidence to vote them out
[16:19:51] Adrian: i’ve been pushing tyler the whole game—why pivot to me now, sidney
[16:19:51] Finley: i’m voting tyler—his sudden defensiveness feels like a smokescreen
[16:20:02] Tyler: finley’s rush to vote without evidence feels as suspicious as adrian’s silence
[16:20:15] Sidney: i’m voting adrian because their sudden shift from silence to defensiveness feels forced
[16:20:27] Kennedy: tyler’s radio silence after adrian’s accusations is looking shady—care to defend yourself
[16:20:31] Tyler: finley, what specific evidence made you flip from adrian to me
[16:20:33] Finley: adrian’s frantic pivot to tyler feels like a panic play, not genuine suspicion
[16:20:36] Adrian: sidney, where is your vote going—me or tyler
[16:20:48] Tyler: kennedy, what solid evidence do you have against me
[16:20:54] Kennedy: sidney, what exact moment made adrian’s defensiveness feel forced
