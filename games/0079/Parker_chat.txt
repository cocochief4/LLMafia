[16:13:37] Parker: drew’s been pretty quiet so far—anyone else find that odd
[16:13:50] Parker: sorry for being quiet, but adrian’s sudden focus on drew feels like deflection
[16:14:55] Parker: sidney, you’ve been pointing fingers without proof—what’s your reasoning
[16:15:11] Parker: good call—my deflection was hasty, let’s pause and hear drew out first
[16:15:34] Parker: tyler, what exactly makes you see drew’s accusations as projection
[16:15:48] Parker: adrian defended drew without questioning my explanation, which feels like mafia coordination
[16:16:00] Parker: tyler, i’m not stalling—i’m steering us toward real evidence, not just hunches
