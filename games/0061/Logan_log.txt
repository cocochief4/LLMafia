[21:51:57] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 1.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:52:04] Ziggy: i’m not seeing any clear suspects yet, what does everyone else think
[21:52:05] Gray: day’s begun—who’s feeling suspicious so far
[21:52:05] Logan: alright, who seems suspicious so far
[21:52:10] Gray: i agree, we should pay attention to who’s been too quiet so far
[21:52:10] Ziggy: does anyone have any early hunches on who the mafia might be
[21:52:13] Logan: i think we should each name one person who’s said the least so far to get started
[21:52:22] Ziggy: logan, you’ve been awfully quiet—care to share your suspicions
[21:52:23] Logan: i’m a bit wary of ziggy steering the convo—anyone else notice that
[21:52:28] Gray: i’ll throw alex out there—they’ve been completely quiet so far
[21:52:30] Ziggy: i’ll say gray since they’ve barely chimed in beyond the initial questions
[21:52:32] Logan: gray, you’ve been awfully quiet too—who’s your top suspect
[21:52:39] Gray: i’m suspicious of ziggy steering us—who here has hardly said a word
[21:52:42] Logan: alex, you’ve been quiet—what’s your read on this
[21:52:50] Gray: i’d actually lean toward sam—their silence has been too convenient
[21:52:57] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time.\nThe rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.\nYou were assigned the following role: bystander.\nThe game's chat room was open at [21:51:57].\nThe other players in the game are:\n* Ziggy (mafia)\nThe other players that have not been eliminated yet are:\n\nIn your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:\n<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;\n<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.\n\nYou must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.\n \n To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a \n hidden sctrachpad where you can perform step-by-step reasoning. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to think before you respond.\n 1. Perform your step-by-step reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. \n 3.
