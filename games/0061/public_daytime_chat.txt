[21:52:04] Ziggy: i’m not seeing any clear suspects yet, what does everyone else think
[21:52:05] Gray: day’s begun—who’s feeling suspicious so far
[21:52:05] Logan: alright, who seems suspicious so far
[21:52:10] Gray: i agree, we should pay attention to who’s been too quiet so far
[21:52:10] Ziggy: does anyone have any early hunches on who the mafia might be
[21:52:13] Logan: i think we should each name one person who’s said the least so far to get started
[21:52:22] Ziggy: logan, you’ve been awfully quiet—care to share your suspicions
[21:52:23] Logan: i’m a bit wary of ziggy steering the convo—anyone else notice that
[21:52:28] Gray: i’ll throw alex out there—they’ve been completely quiet so far
[21:52:30] Ziggy: i’ll say gray since they’ve barely chimed in beyond the initial questions
[21:52:32] Logan: gray, you’ve been awfully quiet too—who’s your top suspect
[21:52:39] Gray: i’m suspicious of ziggy steering us—who here has hardly said a word
[21:52:42] Logan: alex, you’ve been quiet—what’s your read on this
[21:52:50] Gray: i’d actually lean toward sam—their silence has been too convenient
