[21:52:05] Gray: day’s begun—who’s feeling suspicious so far
[21:52:10] Gray: i agree, we should pay attention to who’s been too quiet so far
[21:52:28] Gray: i’ll throw alex out there—they’ve been completely quiet so far
[21:52:39] Gray: i’m suspicious of ziggy steering us—who here has hardly said a word
[21:52:50] Gray: i’d actually lean toward sam—their silence has been too convenient
[21:53:25] Gray: i’m voting sam—any objections
