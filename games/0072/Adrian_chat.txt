[16:49:47] Adrian: let’s hear everyone’s first impressions before making any nominations
[16:50:00] Adrian: let’s each share a quick gut feeling about who seems most suspicious right now
[16:50:07] Adrian: i read alone all night with no alibi, but parker’s silence still feels off
[16:50:14] Adrian: i was reading in my room all night and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:27] Adrian: tyler, can you back up finley’s walk alibi
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now
[16:52:19] Adrian: let’s wrap this up—i’m voting parker
[16:54:09] Adrian: losing two innocents makes finley’s eagerness to vote feel off
[16:54:21] Adrian: kennedy, what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:35] Adrian: finley, which of kennedy’s questions struck you as too pushy
[16:54:53] Adrian: i’m most suspicious of kennedy for pushing incorrect lynches back to back
[16:55:14] Adrian: i’m voting kennedy—her pushiness still feels like a setup
[16:55:22] Adrian: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:41] Adrian: i finished the night circus around 11:30 pm and can share my kindle’s timestamp as proof
[16:55:58] Adrian: i’m ready to lock in kennedy since her logoff time still doesn’t add up
[16:56:41] Adrian: sidney, can you post those computer timestamps now so we can confirm before locking in kennedy
[16:57:33] Adrian: voting kennedy—no more delays
