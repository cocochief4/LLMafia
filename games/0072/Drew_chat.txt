[16:49:47] Drew: morning everyone, any initial suspicions
[16:49:58] Drew: adrian, any alibi or early thoughts on who we should be watching
[16:50:06] Drew: i stayed in my room rewatching movies all night and didn’t see anyone else
[16:50:16] Drew: i was on a video call with my roommate until about midnight and then stayed in my room the rest of the night
[16:50:29] Drew: tyler, can you confirm finley’s alibi from last night so we know who else to watch
[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
