[16:49:43] Kennedy: hey everyone, any early suspicions on who’s mafia
[16:49:43] Sidney: not much info yet—maybe we should ask for alibis before accusing anyone
[16:49:43] Parker: hey everyone, any gut feelings on who we should target for day 1
[16:49:44] Tyler: morning everyone—any initial suspicions
[16:49:45] Finley: morning everyone—any early suspicions on who we should watch
[16:49:47] Drew: morning everyone, any initial suspicions
[16:49:47] Adrian: let’s hear everyone’s first impressions before making any nominations
[16:49:49] Kennedy: does anyone have initial suspicions to get us started
[16:49:51] Sidney: i’m kinda suspicious of parker—he’s been awfully quiet
[16:49:52] Parker: sounds good—adrian and drew, where were you last night
[16:49:53] Tyler: let’s quickly share our night one alibis before voting
[16:49:56] Finley: sounds good—who wants to start with their alibi for last night
[16:49:58] Drew: adrian, any alibi or early thoughts on who we should be watching
[16:50:00] Adrian: let’s each share a quick gut feeling about who seems most suspicious right now
[16:50:02] Kennedy: parker, any thoughts on sidney saying you’ve been awfully quiet
[16:50:03] Tyler: adrian and drew, can you share more details about your whereabouts last night
[16:50:03] Sidney: i haven’t seen much from drew—does anyone else find that a bit odd
[16:50:05] Parker: sidney, what in my behavior made you suspicious of me
[16:50:06] Drew: i stayed in my room rewatching movies all night and didn’t see anyone else
[16:50:07] Adrian: i read alone all night with no alibi, but parker’s silence still feels off
[16:50:08] Finley: i was out walking with tyler last night—he can back me up
[16:50:14] Parker: sidney, what specifically about drew made you suspicious
[16:50:14] Adrian: i was reading in my room all night and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:15] Kennedy: i was home solo on discord until late and didn’t see anyone suspicious, but sidney’s quick parker suspicion strikes me as odd
[16:50:16] Drew: i was on a video call with my roommate until about midnight and then stayed in my room the rest of the night
[16:50:17] Sidney: i was up late finalizing a report for work and never left my desk last night
[16:50:20] Finley: sidney, what exactly about parker’s quietness seemed suspicious to you
[16:50:24] Tyler: sidney, can you share your alibi from last night
[16:50:27] Adrian: tyler, can you back up finley’s walk alibi
[16:50:29] Drew: tyler, can you confirm finley’s alibi from last night so we know who else to watch
[16:50:30] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley wrap up your walk last night
[16:50:30] Kennedy: tyler, can you confirm finley’s walking alibi from last night
[16:50:32] Finley: adrian, what book were you reading last night
[16:50:37] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley head out for your walk
[16:50:38] Tyler: sounds good—i can back up finley’s alibi from our walk last night
[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now
[16:52:09] Sidney: i can share my computer timestamps to prove i stayed at my desk all night
[16:52:19] Adrian: let’s wrap this up—i’m voting parker
[16:52:20] Tyler: finley, what’s your vote so we can reach a majority
[16:52:23] Sidney: parker’s timeline is still inconsistent—vote parker
[16:52:29] Finley: tyler, did you see parker during your walk between 10 and 11pm
[16:52:37] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:52:48] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[16:52:48] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[16:52:48] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[16:52:49] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sidney
[16:52:52] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sidney
[16:52:53] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[16:52:56] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[16:54:05] Kennedy: lynching two innocents in a row is a red flag—let’s review everyone’s moves before voting
[16:54:07] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy
[16:54:09] Adrian: losing two innocents makes finley’s eagerness to vote feel off
[16:54:10] Finley: lock in kennedy—her pushy questions make her too risky
[16:54:21] Adrian: kennedy, what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:24] Tyler: with drew gone, who’s everyone’s top suspect now
[16:54:25] Finley: agreed—let’s review everyone’s alibis and votes before deciding again
[16:54:25] Sidney: agreed—let’s hear more from adrian and tyler before voting
[16:54:31] Kennedy: i’m getting a weird vibe from finley’s eagerness to second every nomination—what do you all think
[16:54:35] Adrian: finley, which of kennedy’s questions struck you as too pushy
[16:54:38] Tyler: kennedy, can you share what time you went offline last night so we can confirm your timeline
[16:54:38] Sidney: i’m still not convinced by kennedy’s timeline—what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:38] Finley: i’m firmly on kennedy—her over-eagerness is our biggest red flag right now
[16:54:47] Kennedy: i logged off around midnight and then went offline until morning
[16:54:49] Finley: her repeated insistence on exact timestamps for my walk alibi felt like she was trying to entrap me
[16:54:53] Adrian: i’m most suspicious of kennedy for pushing incorrect lynches back to back
[16:54:58] Kennedy: i logged off discord at 1:15 am last night
[16:55:01] Sidney: lock in kennedy—her logoff time is still unverified
[16:55:02] Tyler: i’m leaning towards finley as my top suspect—thoughts
[16:55:08] Sidney: kennedy’s logoff time keeps shifting—lock in kennedy
[16:55:13] Tyler: adrian or sidney, did you see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:14] Adrian: i’m voting kennedy—her pushiness still feels like a setup
[16:55:14] Finley: tyler, you already backed my alibi—let’s lock in kennedy for her conflicting timestamps
[16:55:15] Kennedy: adrian, what time did you finish reading “the night circus” last night and can you back that up
[16:55:22] Adrian: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:25] Sidney: tyler, finley’s walk logs align perfectly—i’m still hung up on kennedy’s inconsistent logoff time
[16:55:29] Tyler: i’m locking in kennedy—her logoff time inconsistencies are too glaring to ignore
[16:55:31] Finley: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight—lock her in
[16:55:35] Kennedy: finley, please explain why you’ve eagerly seconded every nomination before we vote
[16:55:38] Sidney: tyler, did you see kennedy online after midnight as well
[16:55:41] Adrian: i finished the night circus around 11:30 pm and can share my kindle’s timestamp as proof
[16:55:43] Tyler: i’m voting kennedy—no one saw her online after midnight
[16:55:50] Kennedy: isn’t finley’s eagerness to lynch me before any proper discussion more suspicious
[16:55:58] Adrian: i’m ready to lock in kennedy since her logoff time still doesn’t add up
[16:56:01] Finley: even with adrian’s proof, kennedy’s shifting logoff times still feel suspicious—vote her
[16:56:08] Finley: locking kennedy in—her logoff stories just don’t add up
[16:56:11] Sidney: kennedy’s constant timeline changes feel like stalling tactics—vote kennedy
[16:56:13] Tyler: finley, can you explain why you’re so quick to second kennedy’s nomination
[16:56:14] Kennedy: should we hold off voting until sidney shares her computer timestamps
[16:56:22] Sidney: i stand by locking in kennedy—her timeline doesn’t add up
[16:56:31] Finley: her shifting timeline is proof enough for me to act immediately
[16:56:31] Kennedy: lock in finley—her eagerness to second every vote is way more suspicious than my logoff time
[16:56:36] Tyler: without sidney’s computer timestamps, i’m locking in my vote for kennedy
[16:56:41] Adrian: sidney, can you post those computer timestamps now so we can confirm before locking in kennedy
[16:56:43] Kennedy: i can upload my discord offline timestamp right now to clear this up
[16:56:44] Finley: sidney, please post your computer timestamps now so we can vote
[16:56:50] Tyler: that’s just deflection—i’m still voting kennedy
[16:56:53] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:57:02] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Kennedy
[16:57:03] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[16:57:10] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[16:57:13] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Kennedy
[16:57:20] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Finley
