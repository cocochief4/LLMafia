## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you must explain your reasoning behind your words and actions. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to explain your reasoning before you respond.
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

At Night, any Mafia players collaborate in private to kill one Bystander. The Mafia win if they equal or outnumber the Bystanders; the Bystanders win by voting out all Mafia. Let’s get started!

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia.

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you must explain your reasoning behind your words and actions. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to explain your reasoning before you respond.

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia.

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia.

[16:50:14] Adrian: i was reading in my room all night and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:15] Kennedy: i was home solo on discord until late and didn’t see anyone suspicious, but sidney’s quick parker suspicion strikes me as odd
[16:50:16] Drew: i was on a video call with my roommate until about midnight and then stayed in my room the rest of the night
[16:50:17] Sidney: i was up late finalizing a report for work and never left my desk last night
[16:50:20] Finley: sidney, what exactly about parker’s quietness seemed suspicious to you
[16:50:24] Tyler: sidney, can you share your alibi from last night
[16:50:27] Adrian: tyler, can you back up finley’s walk alibi
[16:50:29] Drew: tyler, can you confirm finley’s alibi from last night so we know who else to watch
[16:50:30] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley wrap up your walk last night

[16:50:32] Finley: adrian, what book were you reading last night
[16:50:37] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley head out for your walk
[16:50:38] Tyler: sounds good—i can back up finley’s alibi from our walk last night
[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker

[16:50:30] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley wrap up your walk last night
[16:50:30] Kennedy: tyler, can you confirm finley’s walking alibi from last night
[16:50:32] Finley: adrian, what book were you reading last night
[16:50:37] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley head out for your walk
[16:50:38] Tyler: sounds good—i can back up finley’s alibi from our walk last night
[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)

<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you must explain your reasoning behind your words and actions. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to explain your reasoning before you respond.
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote

[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him

[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker

The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia.

[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)

<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you must explain your reasoning behind your words and actions. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to explain your reasoning before you respond.
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now
[16:52:09] Sidney: i can share my computer timestamps to prove i stayed at my desk all night
[16:52:19] Adrian: let’s wrap this up—i’m voting parker
[16:52:20] Tyler: finley, what’s your vote so we can reach a majority
[16:52:23] Sidney: parker’s timeline is still inconsistent—vote parker

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)

 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:

[16:50:37] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley head out for your walk
[16:50:38] Tyler: sounds good—i can back up finley’s alibi from our walk last night
[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline

[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up

[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me

[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet

The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (mafia)

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you must explain your reasoning behind your words and actions. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to explain your reasoning before you respond.
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>.

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:

[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky

[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (mafia)
 Kennedy (bystander)

<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you must explain your reasoning behind your words and actions. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to explain your reasoning before you respond.
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:

 Sidney (mafia)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (mafia)
 Kennedy (bystander)

[16:50:32] Finley: adrian, what book were you reading last night
[16:50:37] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley head out for your walk
[16:50:38] Tyler: sounds good—i can back up finley’s alibi from our walk last night
[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now
[16:52:09] Sidney: i can share my computer timestamps to prove i stayed at my desk all night
[16:52:19] Adrian: let’s wrap this up—i’m voting parker
[16:52:20] Tyler: finley, what’s your vote so we can reach a majority
[16:52:23] Sidney: parker’s timeline is still inconsistent—vote parker

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia.

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (mafia)

[16:49:43] Kennedy: hey everyone, any early suspicions on who’s mafia
[16:49:43] Sidney: not much info yet—maybe we should ask for alibis before accusing anyone
[16:49:43] Parker: hey everyone, any gut feelings on who we should target for day 1

[16:50:02] Kennedy: parker, any thoughts on sidney saying you’ve been awfully quiet
[16:50:03] Tyler: adrian and drew, can you share more details about your whereabouts last night
[16:50:03] Sidney: i haven’t seen much from drew—does anyone else find that a bit odd
[16:50:05] Parker: sidney, what in my behavior made you suspicious of me
[16:50:06] Drew: i stayed in my room rewatching movies all night and didn’t see anyone else
[16:50:07] Adrian: i read alone all night with no alibi, but parker’s silence still feels off
[16:50:08] Finley: i was out walking with tyler last night—he can back me up
[16:50:14] Parker: sidney, what specifically about drew made you suspicious
[16:50:14] Adrian: i was reading in my room all night and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:15] Kennedy: i was home solo on discord until late and didn’t see anyone suspicious, but sidney’s quick parker suspicion strikes me as odd
[16:50:16] Drew: i was on a video call with my roommate until about midnight and then stayed in my room the rest of the night
[16:50:17] Sidney: i was up late finalizing a report for work and never left my desk last night
[16:50:20] Finley: sidney, what exactly about parker’s quietness seemed suspicious to you
[16:50:24] Tyler: sidney, can you share your alibi from last night
[16:50:27] Adrian: tyler, can you back up finley’s walk alibi
[16:50:29] Drew: tyler, can you confirm finley’s alibi from last night so we know who else to watch
[16:50:30] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley wrap up your walk last night
[16:50:30] Kennedy: tyler, can you confirm finley’s walking alibi from last night
[16:50:32] Finley: adrian, what book were you reading last night
[16:50:37] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley head out for your walk
[16:50:38] Tyler: sounds good—i can back up finley’s alibi from our walk last night
[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving

[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)

[16:50:00] Adrian: let’s each share a quick gut feeling about who seems most suspicious right now
[16:50:02] Kennedy: parker, any thoughts on sidney saying you’ve been awfully quiet
[16:50:03] Tyler: adrian and drew, can you share more details about your whereabouts last night
[16:50:03] Sidney: i haven’t seen much from drew—does anyone else find that a bit odd
[16:50:05] Parker: sidney, what in my behavior made you suspicious of me
[16:50:06] Drew: i stayed in my room rewatching movies all night and didn’t see anyone else
[16:50:07] Adrian: i read alone all night with no alibi, but parker’s silence still feels off
[16:50:08] Finley: i was out walking with tyler last night—he can back me up
[16:50:14] Parker: sidney, what specifically about drew made you suspicious
[16:50:14] Adrian: i was reading in my room all night and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:15] Kennedy: i was home solo on discord until late and didn’t see anyone suspicious, but sidney’s quick parker suspicion strikes me as odd
[16:50:16] Drew: i was on a video call with my roommate until about midnight and then stayed in my room the rest of the night
[16:50:17] Sidney: i was up late finalizing a report for work and never left my desk last night
[16:50:20] Finley: sidney, what exactly about parker’s quietness seemed suspicious to you
[16:50:24] Tyler: sidney, can you share your alibi from last night
[16:50:27] Adrian: tyler, can you back up finley’s walk alibi
[16:50:29] Drew: tyler, can you confirm finley’s alibi from last night so we know who else to watch
[16:50:30] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley wrap up your walk last night
[16:50:30] Kennedy: tyler, can you confirm finley’s walking alibi from last night
[16:50:32] Finley: adrian, what book were you reading last night
[16:50:37] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley head out for your walk
[16:50:38] Tyler: sounds good—i can back up finley’s alibi from our walk last night
[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now
[16:52:09] Sidney: i can share my computer timestamps to prove i stayed at my desk all night

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (mafia)

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you must explain your reasoning behind your words and actions. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to explain your reasoning before you respond.
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>.

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (mafia)
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you must explain your reasoning behind your words and actions. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to explain your reasoning before you respond.
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[16:49:43] Sidney: not much info yet—maybe we should ask for alibis before accusing anyone
[16:49:43] Parker: hey everyone, any gut feelings on who we should target for day 1
[16:49:44] Tyler: morning everyone—any initial suspicions
[16:49:45] Finley: morning everyone—any early suspicions on who we should watch

[16:50:03] Tyler: adrian and drew, can you share more details about your whereabouts last night
[16:50:03] Sidney: i haven’t seen much from drew—does anyone else find that a bit odd
[16:50:05] Parker: sidney, what in my behavior made you suspicious of me
[16:50:06] Drew: i stayed in my room rewatching movies all night and didn’t see anyone else
[16:50:07] Adrian: i read alone all night with no alibi, but parker’s silence still feels off
[16:50:08] Finley: i was out walking with tyler last night—he can back me up
[16:50:14] Parker: sidney, what specifically about drew made you suspicious
[16:50:14] Adrian: i was reading in my room all night and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:15] Kennedy: i was home solo on discord until late and didn’t see anyone suspicious, but sidney’s quick parker suspicion strikes me as odd
[16:50:16] Drew: i was on a video call with my roommate until about midnight and then stayed in my room the rest of the night
[16:50:17] Sidney: i was up late finalizing a report for work and never left my desk last night
[16:50:20] Finley: sidney, what exactly about parker’s quietness seemed suspicious to you
[16:50:24] Tyler: sidney, can you share your alibi from last night
[16:50:27] Adrian: tyler, can you back up finley’s walk alibi
[16:50:29] Drew: tyler, can you confirm finley’s alibi from last night so we know who else to watch
[16:50:30] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley wrap up your walk last night
[16:50:30] Kennedy: tyler, can you confirm finley’s walking alibi from last night
[16:50:32] Finley: adrian, what book were you reading last night
[16:50:37] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley head out for your walk
[16:50:38] Tyler: sounds good—i can back up finley’s alibi from our walk last night
[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now
[16:52:09] Sidney: i can share my computer timestamps to prove i stayed at my desk all night

[16:52:20] Tyler: finley, what’s your vote so we can reach a majority
[16:52:23] Sidney: parker’s timeline is still inconsistent—vote parker
[16:52:29] Finley: tyler, did you see parker during your walk between 10 and 11pm

[16:49:43] Kennedy: hey everyone, any early suspicions on who’s mafia

[16:49:43] Parker: hey everyone, any gut feelings on who we should target for day 1
[16:49:44] Tyler: morning everyone—any initial suspicions
[16:49:45] Finley: morning everyone—any early suspicions on who we should watch

[16:50:00] Adrian: let’s each share a quick gut feeling about who seems most suspicious right now
[16:50:02] Kennedy: parker, any thoughts on sidney saying you’ve been awfully quiet
[16:50:03] Tyler: adrian and drew, can you share more details about your whereabouts last night
[16:50:03] Sidney: i haven’t seen much from drew—does anyone else find that a bit odd
[16:50:05] Parker: sidney, what in my behavior made you suspicious of me
[16:50:06] Drew: i stayed in my room rewatching movies all night and didn’t see anyone else
[16:50:07] Adrian: i read alone all night with no alibi, but parker’s silence still feels off
[16:50:08] Finley: i was out walking with tyler last night—he can back me up
[16:50:14] Parker: sidney, what specifically about drew made you suspicious
[16:50:14] Adrian: i was reading in my room all night and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:15] Kennedy: i was home solo on discord until late and didn’t see anyone suspicious, but sidney’s quick parker suspicion strikes me as odd
[16:50:16] Drew: i was on a video call with my roommate until about midnight and then stayed in my room the rest of the night
[16:50:17] Sidney: i was up late finalizing a report for work and never left my desk last night
[16:50:20] Finley: sidney, what exactly about parker’s quietness seemed suspicious to you
[16:50:24] Tyler: sidney, can you share your alibi from last night
[16:50:27] Adrian: tyler, can you back up finley’s walk alibi
[16:50:29] Drew: tyler, can you confirm finley’s alibi from last night so we know who else to watch
[16:50:30] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley wrap up your walk last night
[16:50:30] Kennedy: tyler, can you confirm finley’s walking alibi from last night
[16:50:32] Finley: adrian, what book were you reading last night
[16:50:37] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley head out for your walk
[16:50:38] Tyler: sounds good—i can back up finley’s alibi from our walk last night
[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now
[16:52:09] Sidney: i can share my computer timestamps to prove i stayed at my desk all night
[16:52:19] Adrian: let’s wrap this up—i’m voting parker
[16:52:20] Tyler: finley, what’s your vote so we can reach a majority
[16:52:23] Sidney: parker’s timeline is still inconsistent—vote parker
[16:52:29] Finley: tyler, did you see parker during your walk between 10 and 11pm

[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.

[16:54:07] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy
[16:54:09] Adrian: losing two innocents makes finley’s eagerness to vote feel off
[16:53:52] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Drew
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[16:54:10] Finley: lock in kennedy—her pushy questions make her too risky
[16:54:21] Adrian: kennedy, what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:24] Tyler: with drew gone, who’s everyone’s top suspect now
[16:54:25] Finley: agreed—let’s review everyone’s alibis and votes before deciding again
[16:54:25] Sidney: agreed—let’s hear more from adrian and tyler before voting
[16:54:31] Kennedy: i’m getting a weird vibe from finley’s eagerness to second every nomination—what do you all think
[16:54:35] Adrian: finley, which of kennedy’s questions struck you as too pushy
[16:54:38] Tyler: kennedy, can you share what time you went offline last night so we can confirm your timeline
[16:54:38] Sidney: i’m still not convinced by kennedy’s timeline—what time did you log off discord last night

[16:50:03] Sidney: i haven’t seen much from drew—does anyone else find that a bit odd
[16:50:05] Parker: sidney, what in my behavior made you suspicious of me
[16:50:06] Drew: i stayed in my room rewatching movies all night and didn’t see anyone else
[16:50:07] Adrian: i read alone all night with no alibi, but parker’s silence still feels off
[16:50:08] Finley: i was out walking with tyler last night—he can back me up
[16:50:14] Parker: sidney, what specifically about drew made you suspicious
[16:50:14] Adrian: i was reading in my room all night and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:15] Kennedy: i was home solo on discord until late and didn’t see anyone suspicious, but sidney’s quick parker suspicion strikes me as odd
[16:50:16] Drew: i was on a video call with my roommate until about midnight and then stayed in my room the rest of the night
[16:50:17] Sidney: i was up late finalizing a report for work and never left my desk last night
[16:50:20] Finley: sidney, what exactly about parker’s quietness seemed suspicious to you
[16:50:24] Tyler: sidney, can you share your alibi from last night
[16:50:27] Adrian: tyler, can you back up finley’s walk alibi
[16:50:29] Drew: tyler, can you confirm finley’s alibi from last night so we know who else to watch
[16:50:30] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley wrap up your walk last night
[16:50:30] Kennedy: tyler, can you confirm finley’s walking alibi from last night
[16:50:32] Finley: adrian, what book were you reading last night
[16:50:37] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley head out for your walk
[16:50:38] Tyler: sounds good—i can back up finley’s alibi from our walk last night
[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now
[16:52:09] Sidney: i can share my computer timestamps to prove i stayed at my desk all night
[16:52:19] Adrian: let’s wrap this up—i’m voting parker

[16:54:31] Kennedy: i’m getting a weird vibe from finley’s eagerness to second every nomination—what do you all think
[16:54:35] Adrian: finley, which of kennedy’s questions struck you as too pushy
[16:54:38] Tyler: kennedy, can you share what time you went offline last night so we can confirm your timeline
[16:54:38] Sidney: i’m still not convinced by kennedy’s timeline—what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:38] Finley: i’m firmly on kennedy—her over-eagerness is our biggest red flag right now
[16:54:47] Kennedy: i logged off around midnight and then went offline until morning

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (mafia)
In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you must explain your reasoning behind your words and actions. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to explain your reasoning before you respond.
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[16:50:03] Sidney: i haven’t seen much from drew—does anyone else find that a bit odd
[16:50:05] Parker: sidney, what in my behavior made you suspicious of me
[16:50:06] Drew: i stayed in my room rewatching movies all night and didn’t see anyone else
[16:50:07] Adrian: i read alone all night with no alibi, but parker’s silence still feels off
[16:50:08] Finley: i was out walking with tyler last night—he can back me up
[16:50:14] Parker: sidney, what specifically about drew made you suspicious
[16:50:14] Adrian: i was reading in my room all night and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:15] Kennedy: i was home solo on discord until late and didn’t see anyone suspicious, but sidney’s quick parker suspicion strikes me as odd
[16:50:16] Drew: i was on a video call with my roommate until about midnight and then stayed in my room the rest of the night
[16:50:17] Sidney: i was up late finalizing a report for work and never left my desk last night
[16:50:20] Finley: sidney, what exactly about parker’s quietness seemed suspicious to you
[16:50:24] Tyler: sidney, can you share your alibi from last night
[16:50:27] Adrian: tyler, can you back up finley’s walk alibi
[16:50:29] Drew: tyler, can you confirm finley’s alibi from last night so we know who else to watch
[16:50:30] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley wrap up your walk last night
[16:50:30] Kennedy: tyler, can you confirm finley’s walking alibi from last night
[16:50:32] Finley: adrian, what book were you reading last night
[16:50:37] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley head out for your walk
[16:50:38] Tyler: sounds good—i can back up finley’s alibi from our walk last night
[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now
[16:52:09] Sidney: i can share my computer timestamps to prove i stayed at my desk all night
[16:52:19] Adrian: let’s wrap this up—i’m voting parker
[16:52:20] Tyler: finley, what’s your vote so we can reach a majority
[16:52:23] Sidney: parker’s timeline is still inconsistent—vote parker
[16:52:29] Finley: tyler, did you see parker during your walk between 10 and 11pm
[16:52:37] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

[16:53:18] Sidney: tyler, you’re the tiebreaker—who are you voting for
[16:53:19] Finley: let’s take out drew tonight
[16:53:26] Sidney: i’m with you—kennedy’s been pushing too hard, let’s take her out
[16:53:26] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:54:05] Kennedy: lynching two innocents in a row is a red flag—let’s review everyone’s moves before voting
[16:54:07] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy
[16:54:09] Adrian: losing two innocents makes finley’s eagerness to vote feel off
[16:53:52] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Drew
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[16:54:10] Finley: lock in kennedy—her pushy questions make her too risky
[16:54:21] Adrian: kennedy, what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:24] Tyler: with drew gone, who’s everyone’s top suspect now
[16:54:25] Finley: agreed—let’s review everyone’s alibis and votes before deciding again
[16:54:25] Sidney: agreed—let’s hear more from adrian and tyler before voting
[16:54:31] Kennedy: i’m getting a weird vibe from finley’s eagerness to second every nomination—what do you all think
[16:54:35] Adrian: finley, which of kennedy’s questions struck you as too pushy
[16:54:38] Tyler: kennedy, can you share what time you went offline last night so we can confirm your timeline
[16:54:38] Sidney: i’m still not convinced by kennedy’s timeline—what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:38] Finley: i’m firmly on kennedy—her over-eagerness is our biggest red flag right now
[16:54:47] Kennedy: i logged off around midnight and then went offline until morning
[16:54:49] Finley: her repeated insistence on exact timestamps for my walk alibi felt like she was trying to entrap me
[16:54:53] Adrian: i’m most suspicious of kennedy for pushing incorrect lynches back to back

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (mafia)

<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you must explain your reasoning behind your words and actions. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to explain your reasoning before you respond.
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[16:50:17] Sidney: i was up late finalizing a report for work and never left my desk last night
[16:50:20] Finley: sidney, what exactly about parker’s quietness seemed suspicious to you
[16:50:24] Tyler: sidney, can you share your alibi from last night
[16:50:27] Adrian: tyler, can you back up finley’s walk alibi
[16:50:29] Drew: tyler, can you confirm finley’s alibi from last night so we know who else to watch
[16:50:30] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley wrap up your walk last night
[16:50:30] Kennedy: tyler, can you confirm finley’s walking alibi from last night
[16:50:32] Finley: adrian, what book were you reading last night
[16:50:37] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley head out for your walk
[16:50:38] Tyler: sounds good—i can back up finley’s alibi from our walk last night
[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now
[16:52:09] Sidney: i can share my computer timestamps to prove i stayed at my desk all night
[16:52:19] Adrian: let’s wrap this up—i’m voting parker
[16:52:20] Tyler: finley, what’s your vote so we can reach a majority
[16:52:23] Sidney: parker’s timeline is still inconsistent—vote parker
[16:52:29] Finley: tyler, did you see parker during your walk between 10 and 11pm
[16:52:37] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

[16:53:19] Finley: let’s take out drew tonight
[16:53:26] Sidney: i’m with you—kennedy’s been pushing too hard, let’s take her out
[16:53:26] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:54:05] Kennedy: lynching two innocents in a row is a red flag—let’s review everyone’s moves before voting
[16:54:07] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy
[16:54:09] Adrian: losing two innocents makes finley’s eagerness to vote feel off
[16:53:52] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Drew
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[16:54:10] Finley: lock in kennedy—her pushy questions make her too risky
[16:54:21] Adrian: kennedy, what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:24] Tyler: with drew gone, who’s everyone’s top suspect now
[16:54:25] Finley: agreed—let’s review everyone’s alibis and votes before deciding again
[16:54:25] Sidney: agreed—let’s hear more from adrian and tyler before voting
[16:54:31] Kennedy: i’m getting a weird vibe from finley’s eagerness to second every nomination—what do you all think
[16:54:35] Adrian: finley, which of kennedy’s questions struck you as too pushy
[16:54:38] Tyler: kennedy, can you share what time you went offline last night so we can confirm your timeline
[16:54:38] Sidney: i’m still not convinced by kennedy’s timeline—what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:38] Finley: i’m firmly on kennedy—her over-eagerness is our biggest red flag right now
[16:54:47] Kennedy: i logged off around midnight and then went offline until morning
[16:54:49] Finley: her repeated insistence on exact timestamps for my walk alibi felt like she was trying to entrap me
[16:54:53] Adrian: i’m most suspicious of kennedy for pushing incorrect lynches back to back
[16:54:58] Kennedy: i logged off discord at 1:15 am last night
[16:55:01] Sidney: lock in kennedy—her logoff time is still unverified
[16:55:02] Tyler: i’m leaning towards finley as my top suspect—thoughts

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:

 Sidney (mafia)

[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now
[16:52:09] Sidney: i can share my computer timestamps to prove i stayed at my desk all night
[16:52:19] Adrian: let’s wrap this up—i’m voting parker
[16:52:20] Tyler: finley, what’s your vote so we can reach a majority
[16:52:23] Sidney: parker’s timeline is still inconsistent—vote parker
[16:52:29] Finley: tyler, did you see parker during your walk between 10 and 11pm
[16:52:37] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

[16:53:19] Finley: let’s take out drew tonight
[16:53:26] Sidney: i’m with you—kennedy’s been pushing too hard, let’s take her out
[16:53:26] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

[16:54:05] Kennedy: lynching two innocents in a row is a red flag—let’s review everyone’s moves before voting
[16:54:07] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy
[16:54:09] Adrian: losing two innocents makes finley’s eagerness to vote feel off
[16:53:52] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Drew
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[16:54:10] Finley: lock in kennedy—her pushy questions make her too risky

[16:54:25] Finley: agreed—let’s review everyone’s alibis and votes before deciding again
[16:54:25] Sidney: agreed—let’s hear more from adrian and tyler before voting
[16:54:31] Kennedy: i’m getting a weird vibe from finley’s eagerness to second every nomination—what do you all think
[16:54:35] Adrian: finley, which of kennedy’s questions struck you as too pushy
[16:54:38] Tyler: kennedy, can you share what time you went offline last night so we can confirm your timeline
[16:54:38] Sidney: i’m still not convinced by kennedy’s timeline—what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:38] Finley: i’m firmly on kennedy—her over-eagerness is our biggest red flag right now
[16:54:47] Kennedy: i logged off around midnight and then went offline until morning
[16:54:49] Finley: her repeated insistence on exact timestamps for my walk alibi felt like she was trying to entrap me
[16:54:53] Adrian: i’m most suspicious of kennedy for pushing incorrect lynches back to back
[16:54:58] Kennedy: i logged off discord at 1:15 am last night
[16:55:01] Sidney: lock in kennedy—her logoff time is still unverified
[16:55:02] Tyler: i’m leaning towards finley as my top suspect—thoughts

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (mafia)

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a

[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now
[16:52:09] Sidney: i can share my computer timestamps to prove i stayed at my desk all night
[16:52:19] Adrian: let’s wrap this up—i’m voting parker
[16:52:20] Tyler: finley, what’s your vote so we can reach a majority
[16:52:23] Sidney: parker’s timeline is still inconsistent—vote parker
[16:52:29] Finley: tyler, did you see parker during your walk between 10 and 11pm
[16:52:37] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

[16:53:19] Finley: let’s take out drew tonight
[16:53:26] Sidney: i’m with you—kennedy’s been pushing too hard, let’s take her out

[16:53:52] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Drew
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[16:54:10] Finley: lock in kennedy—her pushy questions make her too risky

[16:54:25] Finley: agreed—let’s review everyone’s alibis and votes before deciding again
[16:54:25] Sidney: agreed—let’s hear more from adrian and tyler before voting
[16:54:31] Kennedy: i’m getting a weird vibe from finley’s eagerness to second every nomination—what do you all think
[16:54:35] Adrian: finley, which of kennedy’s questions struck you as too pushy
[16:54:38] Tyler: kennedy, can you share what time you went offline last night so we can confirm your timeline
[16:54:38] Sidney: i’m still not convinced by kennedy’s timeline—what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:38] Finley: i’m firmly on kennedy—her over-eagerness is our biggest red flag right now
[16:54:47] Kennedy: i logged off around midnight and then went offline until morning
[16:54:49] Finley: her repeated insistence on exact timestamps for my walk alibi felt like she was trying to entrap me
[16:54:53] Adrian: i’m most suspicious of kennedy for pushing incorrect lynches back to back
[16:54:58] Kennedy: i logged off discord at 1:15 am last night
[16:55:01] Sidney: lock in kennedy—her logoff time is still unverified
[16:55:02] Tyler: i’m leaning towards finley as my top suspect—thoughts

[16:55:13] Tyler: adrian or sidney, did you see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:14] Adrian: i’m voting kennedy—her pushiness still feels like a setup

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)

[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now
[16:52:09] Sidney: i can share my computer timestamps to prove i stayed at my desk all night
[16:52:19] Adrian: let’s wrap this up—i’m voting parker
[16:52:20] Tyler: finley, what’s your vote so we can reach a majority
[16:52:23] Sidney: parker’s timeline is still inconsistent—vote parker
[16:52:29] Finley: tyler, did you see parker during your walk between 10 and 11pm
[16:52:37] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:52:56] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander

[16:53:19] Finley: let’s take out drew tonight
[16:53:26] Sidney: i’m with you—kennedy’s been pushing too hard, let’s take her out
[16:53:26] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander

[16:54:05] Kennedy: lynching two innocents in a row is a red flag—let’s review everyone’s moves before voting
[16:54:07] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy
[16:54:09] Adrian: losing two innocents makes finley’s eagerness to vote feel off
[16:53:52] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Drew
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[16:54:10] Finley: lock in kennedy—her pushy questions make her too risky

[16:54:24] Tyler: with drew gone, who’s everyone’s top suspect now
[16:54:25] Finley: agreed—let’s review everyone’s alibis and votes before deciding again
[16:54:25] Sidney: agreed—let’s hear more from adrian and tyler before voting
[16:54:31] Kennedy: i’m getting a weird vibe from finley’s eagerness to second every nomination—what do you all think
[16:54:35] Adrian: finley, which of kennedy’s questions struck you as too pushy
[16:54:38] Tyler: kennedy, can you share what time you went offline last night so we can confirm your timeline
[16:54:38] Sidney: i’m still not convinced by kennedy’s timeline—what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:38] Finley: i’m firmly on kennedy—her over-eagerness is our biggest red flag right now
[16:54:47] Kennedy: i logged off around midnight and then went offline until morning
[16:54:49] Finley: her repeated insistence on exact timestamps for my walk alibi felt like she was trying to entrap me
[16:54:53] Adrian: i’m most suspicious of kennedy for pushing incorrect lynches back to back
[16:54:58] Kennedy: i logged off discord at 1:15 am last night
[16:55:01] Sidney: lock in kennedy—her logoff time is still unverified
[16:55:02] Tyler: i’m leaning towards finley as my top suspect—thoughts
[16:55:08] Sidney: kennedy’s logoff time keeps shifting—lock in kennedy
[16:55:13] Tyler: adrian or sidney, did you see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:14] Adrian: i’m voting kennedy—her pushiness still feels like a setup

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (mafia)

[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky

[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline

[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet

[16:53:52] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Drew
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[16:54:10] Finley: lock in kennedy—her pushy questions make her too risky
[16:54:21] Adrian: kennedy, what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:24] Tyler: with drew gone, who’s everyone’s top suspect now
[16:54:25] Finley: agreed—let’s review everyone’s alibis and votes before deciding again
[16:54:25] Sidney: agreed—let’s hear more from adrian and tyler before voting
[16:54:31] Kennedy: i’m getting a weird vibe from finley’s eagerness to second every nomination—what do you all think
[16:54:35] Adrian: finley, which of kennedy’s questions struck you as too pushy
[16:54:38] Tyler: kennedy, can you share what time you went offline last night so we can confirm your timeline
[16:54:38] Sidney: i’m still not convinced by kennedy’s timeline—what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:38] Finley: i’m firmly on kennedy—her over-eagerness is our biggest red flag right now
[16:54:47] Kennedy: i logged off around midnight and then went offline until morning
[16:54:49] Finley: her repeated insistence on exact timestamps for my walk alibi felt like she was trying to entrap me
[16:54:53] Adrian: i’m most suspicious of kennedy for pushing incorrect lynches back to back
[16:54:58] Kennedy: i logged off discord at 1:15 am last night
[16:55:01] Sidney: lock in kennedy—her logoff time is still unverified
[16:55:02] Tyler: i’m leaning towards finley as my top suspect—thoughts
[16:55:08] Sidney: kennedy’s logoff time keeps shifting—lock in kennedy
[16:55:13] Tyler: adrian or sidney, did you see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:14] Adrian: i’m voting kennedy—her pushiness still feels like a setup
[16:55:14] Finley: tyler, you already backed my alibi—let’s lock in kennedy for her conflicting timestamps
[16:55:15] Kennedy: adrian, what time did you finish reading “the night circus” last night and can you back that up
[16:55:22] Adrian: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:25] Sidney: tyler, finley’s walk logs align perfectly—i’m still hung up on kennedy’s inconsistent logoff time
[16:55:29] Tyler: i’m locking in kennedy—her logoff time inconsistencies are too glaring to ignore

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (mafia)

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you must explain your reasoning behind your words and actions. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to explain your reasoning before you respond.
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[16:50:38] Tyler: sounds good—i can back up finley’s alibi from our walk last night
[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker

[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet

[16:53:52] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Drew

[16:54:25] Finley: agreed—let’s review everyone’s alibis and votes before deciding again
[16:54:25] Sidney: agreed—let’s hear more from adrian and tyler before voting
[16:54:31] Kennedy: i’m getting a weird vibe from finley’s eagerness to second every nomination—what do you all think
[16:54:35] Adrian: finley, which of kennedy’s questions struck you as too pushy
[16:54:38] Tyler: kennedy, can you share what time you went offline last night so we can confirm your timeline
[16:54:38] Sidney: i’m still not convinced by kennedy’s timeline—what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:38] Finley: i’m firmly on kennedy—her over-eagerness is our biggest red flag right now
[16:54:47] Kennedy: i logged off around midnight and then went offline until morning
[16:54:49] Finley: her repeated insistence on exact timestamps for my walk alibi felt like she was trying to entrap me
[16:54:53] Adrian: i’m most suspicious of kennedy for pushing incorrect lynches back to back
[16:54:58] Kennedy: i logged off discord at 1:15 am last night
[16:55:01] Sidney: lock in kennedy—her logoff time is still unverified
[16:55:02] Tyler: i’m leaning towards finley as my top suspect—thoughts
[16:55:08] Sidney: kennedy’s logoff time keeps shifting—lock in kennedy
[16:55:13] Tyler: adrian or sidney, did you see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:14] Adrian: i’m voting kennedy—her pushiness still feels like a setup
[16:55:14] Finley: tyler, you already backed my alibi—let’s lock in kennedy for her conflicting timestamps
[16:55:15] Kennedy: adrian, what time did you finish reading “the night circus” last night and can you back that up
[16:55:22] Adrian: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:25] Sidney: tyler, finley’s walk logs align perfectly—i’m still hung up on kennedy’s inconsistent logoff time
[16:55:29] Tyler: i’m locking in kennedy—her logoff time inconsistencies are too glaring to ignore
[16:55:31] Finley: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight—lock her in

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)

[16:50:14] Adrian: i was reading in my room all night and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:15] Kennedy: i was home solo on discord until late and didn’t see anyone suspicious, but sidney’s quick parker suspicion strikes me as odd
[16:50:16] Drew: i was on a video call with my roommate until about midnight and then stayed in my room the rest of the night
[16:50:17] Sidney: i was up late finalizing a report for work and never left my desk last night
[16:50:20] Finley: sidney, what exactly about parker’s quietness seemed suspicious to you
[16:50:24] Tyler: sidney, can you share your alibi from last night
[16:50:27] Adrian: tyler, can you back up finley’s walk alibi
[16:50:29] Drew: tyler, can you confirm finley’s alibi from last night so we know who else to watch
[16:50:30] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley wrap up your walk last night
[16:50:30] Kennedy: tyler, can you confirm finley’s walking alibi from last night
[16:50:32] Finley: adrian, what book were you reading last night
[16:50:37] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley head out for your walk
[16:50:38] Tyler: sounds good—i can back up finley’s alibi from our walk last night
[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now
[16:52:09] Sidney: i can share my computer timestamps to prove i stayed at my desk all night
[16:52:19] Adrian: let’s wrap this up—i’m voting parker
[16:52:20] Tyler: finley, what’s your vote so we can reach a majority
[16:52:23] Sidney: parker’s timeline is still inconsistent—vote parker
[16:52:29] Finley: tyler, did you see parker during your walk between 10 and 11pm
[16:52:37] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:52:56] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander

[16:53:18] Sidney: tyler, you’re the tiebreaker—who are you voting for
[16:53:19] Finley: let’s take out drew tonight
[16:53:26] Sidney: i’m with you—kennedy’s been pushing too hard, let’s take her out
[16:53:26] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:54:05] Kennedy: lynching two innocents in a row is a red flag—let’s review everyone’s moves before voting
[16:54:07] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy
[16:54:09] Adrian: losing two innocents makes finley’s eagerness to vote feel off
[16:53:52] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Drew
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[16:54:10] Finley: lock in kennedy—her pushy questions make her too risky
[16:54:21] Adrian: kennedy, what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:24] Tyler: with drew gone, who’s everyone’s top suspect now
[16:54:25] Finley: agreed—let’s review everyone’s alibis and votes before deciding again
[16:54:25] Sidney: agreed—let’s hear more from adrian and tyler before voting
[16:54:31] Kennedy: i’m getting a weird vibe from finley’s eagerness to second every nomination—what do you all think
[16:54:35] Adrian: finley, which of kennedy’s questions struck you as too pushy
[16:54:38] Tyler: kennedy, can you share what time you went offline last night so we can confirm your timeline
[16:54:38] Sidney: i’m still not convinced by kennedy’s timeline—what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:38] Finley: i’m firmly on kennedy—her over-eagerness is our biggest red flag right now
[16:54:47] Kennedy: i logged off around midnight and then went offline until morning
[16:54:49] Finley: her repeated insistence on exact timestamps for my walk alibi felt like she was trying to entrap me
[16:54:53] Adrian: i’m most suspicious of kennedy for pushing incorrect lynches back to back
[16:54:58] Kennedy: i logged off discord at 1:15 am last night
[16:55:01] Sidney: lock in kennedy—her logoff time is still unverified
[16:55:02] Tyler: i’m leaning towards finley as my top suspect—thoughts
[16:55:08] Sidney: kennedy’s logoff time keeps shifting—lock in kennedy
[16:55:13] Tyler: adrian or sidney, did you see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:14] Adrian: i’m voting kennedy—her pushiness still feels like a setup
[16:55:14] Finley: tyler, you already backed my alibi—let’s lock in kennedy for her conflicting timestamps
[16:55:15] Kennedy: adrian, what time did you finish reading “the night circus” last night and can you back that up
[16:55:22] Adrian: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:25] Sidney: tyler, finley’s walk logs align perfectly—i’m still hung up on kennedy’s inconsistent logoff time
[16:55:29] Tyler: i’m locking in kennedy—her logoff time inconsistencies are too glaring to ignore
[16:55:31] Finley: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight—lock her in
[16:55:35] Kennedy: finley, please explain why you’ve eagerly seconded every nomination before we vote
[16:55:38] Sidney: tyler, did you see kennedy online after midnight as well
[16:55:41] Adrian: i finished the night circus around 11:30 pm and can share my kindle’s timestamp as proof

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (mafia)

<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you must explain your reasoning behind your words and actions. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to explain your reasoning before you respond.
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[16:49:43] Parker: hey everyone, any gut feelings on who we should target for day 1
[16:49:44] Tyler: morning everyone—any initial suspicions
[16:49:45] Finley: morning everyone—any early suspicions on who we should watch
[16:49:47] Drew: morning everyone, any initial suspicions
[16:49:47] Adrian: let’s hear everyone’s first impressions before making any nominations
[16:49:49] Kennedy: does anyone have initial suspicions to get us started
[16:49:51] Sidney: i’m kinda suspicious of parker—he’s been awfully quiet
[16:49:52] Parker: sounds good—adrian and drew, where were you last night
[16:49:53] Tyler: let’s quickly share our night one alibis before voting
[16:49:56] Finley: sounds good—who wants to start with their alibi for last night
[16:49:58] Drew: adrian, any alibi or early thoughts on who we should be watching
[16:50:00] Adrian: let’s each share a quick gut feeling about who seems most suspicious right now
[16:50:02] Kennedy: parker, any thoughts on sidney saying you’ve been awfully quiet
[16:50:03] Tyler: adrian and drew, can you share more details about your whereabouts last night
[16:50:03] Sidney: i haven’t seen much from drew—does anyone else find that a bit odd
[16:50:05] Parker: sidney, what in my behavior made you suspicious of me
[16:50:06] Drew: i stayed in my room rewatching movies all night and didn’t see anyone else
[16:50:07] Adrian: i read alone all night with no alibi, but parker’s silence still feels off
[16:50:08] Finley: i was out walking with tyler last night—he can back me up
[16:50:14] Parker: sidney, what specifically about drew made you suspicious
[16:50:14] Adrian: i was reading in my room all night and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:15] Kennedy: i was home solo on discord until late and didn’t see anyone suspicious, but sidney’s quick parker suspicion strikes me as odd
[16:50:16] Drew: i was on a video call with my roommate until about midnight and then stayed in my room the rest of the night
[16:50:17] Sidney: i was up late finalizing a report for work and never left my desk last night
[16:50:20] Finley: sidney, what exactly about parker’s quietness seemed suspicious to you
[16:50:24] Tyler: sidney, can you share your alibi from last night
[16:50:27] Adrian: tyler, can you back up finley’s walk alibi
[16:50:29] Drew: tyler, can you confirm finley’s alibi from last night so we know who else to watch
[16:50:30] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley wrap up your walk last night
[16:50:30] Kennedy: tyler, can you confirm finley’s walking alibi from last night
[16:50:32] Finley: adrian, what book were you reading last night
[16:50:37] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley head out for your walk
[16:50:38] Tyler: sounds good—i can back up finley’s alibi from our walk last night
[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now
[16:52:09] Sidney: i can share my computer timestamps to prove i stayed at my desk all night
[16:52:19] Adrian: let’s wrap this up—i’m voting parker
[16:52:20] Tyler: finley, what’s your vote so we can reach a majority
[16:52:23] Sidney: parker’s timeline is still inconsistent—vote parker
[16:52:29] Finley: tyler, did you see parker during your walk between 10 and 11pm
[16:52:37] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:52:56] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[16:52:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.

[16:52:49] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sidney
[16:52:52] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sidney
[16:52:53] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[16:52:56] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[16:53:09] Finley: let’s take out kennedy tonight—she’s been too pushy and could start digging into us
[16:53:18] Sidney: tyler, you’re the tiebreaker—who are you voting for
[16:53:19] Finley: let’s take out drew tonight
[16:53:26] Sidney: i’m with you—kennedy’s been pushing too hard, let’s take her out
[16:53:26] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:54:05] Kennedy: lynching two innocents in a row is a red flag—let’s review everyone’s moves before voting
[16:54:07] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy
[16:54:09] Adrian: losing two innocents makes finley’s eagerness to vote feel off
[16:53:52] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Drew
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[16:54:10] Finley: lock in kennedy—her pushy questions make her too risky
[16:54:21] Adrian: kennedy, what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:24] Tyler: with drew gone, who’s everyone’s top suspect now
[16:54:25] Finley: agreed—let’s review everyone’s alibis and votes before deciding again
[16:54:25] Sidney: agreed—let’s hear more from adrian and tyler before voting
[16:54:31] Kennedy: i’m getting a weird vibe from finley’s eagerness to second every nomination—what do you all think
[16:54:35] Adrian: finley, which of kennedy’s questions struck you as too pushy
[16:54:38] Tyler: kennedy, can you share what time you went offline last night so we can confirm your timeline
[16:54:38] Sidney: i’m still not convinced by kennedy’s timeline—what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:38] Finley: i’m firmly on kennedy—her over-eagerness is our biggest red flag right now
[16:54:47] Kennedy: i logged off around midnight and then went offline until morning
[16:54:49] Finley: her repeated insistence on exact timestamps for my walk alibi felt like she was trying to entrap me
[16:54:53] Adrian: i’m most suspicious of kennedy for pushing incorrect lynches back to back
[16:54:58] Kennedy: i logged off discord at 1:15 am last night
[16:55:01] Sidney: lock in kennedy—her logoff time is still unverified
[16:55:02] Tyler: i’m leaning towards finley as my top suspect—thoughts
[16:55:08] Sidney: kennedy’s logoff time keeps shifting—lock in kennedy
[16:55:13] Tyler: adrian or sidney, did you see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:14] Adrian: i’m voting kennedy—her pushiness still feels like a setup
[16:55:14] Finley: tyler, you already backed my alibi—let’s lock in kennedy for her conflicting timestamps
[16:55:15] Kennedy: adrian, what time did you finish reading “the night circus” last night and can you back that up
[16:55:22] Adrian: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:25] Sidney: tyler, finley’s walk logs align perfectly—i’m still hung up on kennedy’s inconsistent logoff time
[16:55:29] Tyler: i’m locking in kennedy—her logoff time inconsistencies are too glaring to ignore
[16:55:31] Finley: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight—lock her in
[16:55:35] Kennedy: finley, please explain why you’ve eagerly seconded every nomination before we vote
[16:55:38] Sidney: tyler, did you see kennedy online after midnight as well
[16:55:41] Adrian: i finished the night circus around 11:30 pm and can share my kindle’s timestamp as proof
[16:55:43] Tyler: i’m voting kennedy—no one saw her online after midnight
[16:55:50] Kennedy: isn’t finley’s eagerness to lynch me before any proper discussion more suspicious
[16:55:58] Adrian: i’m ready to lock in kennedy since her logoff time still doesn’t add up

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:

[16:50:05] Parker: sidney, what in my behavior made you suspicious of me
[16:50:06] Drew: i stayed in my room rewatching movies all night and didn’t see anyone else
[16:50:07] Adrian: i read alone all night with no alibi, but parker’s silence still feels off
[16:50:08] Finley: i was out walking with tyler last night—he can back me up
[16:50:14] Parker: sidney, what specifically about drew made you suspicious
[16:50:14] Adrian: i was reading in my room all night and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:15] Kennedy: i was home solo on discord until late and didn’t see anyone suspicious, but sidney’s quick parker suspicion strikes me as odd
[16:50:16] Drew: i was on a video call with my roommate until about midnight and then stayed in my room the rest of the night
[16:50:17] Sidney: i was up late finalizing a report for work and never left my desk last night
[16:50:20] Finley: sidney, what exactly about parker’s quietness seemed suspicious to you
[16:50:24] Tyler: sidney, can you share your alibi from last night
[16:50:27] Adrian: tyler, can you back up finley’s walk alibi
[16:50:29] Drew: tyler, can you confirm finley’s alibi from last night so we know who else to watch

[16:50:38] Tyler: sounds good—i can back up finley’s alibi from our walk last night
[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline

[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now
[16:52:09] Sidney: i can share my computer timestamps to prove i stayed at my desk all night

[16:52:20] Tyler: finley, what’s your vote so we can reach a majority
[16:52:23] Sidney: parker’s timeline is still inconsistent—vote parker
[16:52:29] Finley: tyler, did you see parker during your walk between 10 and 11pm

[16:54:07] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy
[16:54:09] Adrian: losing two innocents makes finley’s eagerness to vote feel off
[16:53:52] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Drew
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[16:54:10] Finley: lock in kennedy—her pushy questions make her too risky
[16:54:21] Adrian: kennedy, what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:24] Tyler: with drew gone, who’s everyone’s top suspect now
[16:54:25] Finley: agreed—let’s review everyone’s alibis and votes before deciding again
[16:54:25] Sidney: agreed—let’s hear more from adrian and tyler before voting
[16:54:31] Kennedy: i’m getting a weird vibe from finley’s eagerness to second every nomination—what do you all think
[16:54:35] Adrian: finley, which of kennedy’s questions struck you as too pushy
[16:54:38] Tyler: kennedy, can you share what time you went offline last night so we can confirm your timeline
[16:54:38] Sidney: i’m still not convinced by kennedy’s timeline—what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:38] Finley: i’m firmly on kennedy—her over-eagerness is our biggest red flag right now
[16:54:47] Kennedy: i logged off around midnight and then went offline until morning
[16:54:49] Finley: her repeated insistence on exact timestamps for my walk alibi felt like she was trying to entrap me
[16:54:53] Adrian: i’m most suspicious of kennedy for pushing incorrect lynches back to back
[16:54:58] Kennedy: i logged off discord at 1:15 am last night
[16:55:01] Sidney: lock in kennedy—her logoff time is still unverified
[16:55:02] Tyler: i’m leaning towards finley as my top suspect—thoughts
[16:55:08] Sidney: kennedy’s logoff time keeps shifting—lock in kennedy
[16:55:13] Tyler: adrian or sidney, did you see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:14] Adrian: i’m voting kennedy—her pushiness still feels like a setup
[16:55:14] Finley: tyler, you already backed my alibi—let’s lock in kennedy for her conflicting timestamps
[16:55:15] Kennedy: adrian, what time did you finish reading “the night circus” last night and can you back that up
[16:55:22] Adrian: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:25] Sidney: tyler, finley’s walk logs align perfectly—i’m still hung up on kennedy’s inconsistent logoff time
[16:55:29] Tyler: i’m locking in kennedy—her logoff time inconsistencies are too glaring to ignore
[16:55:31] Finley: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight—lock her in
[16:55:35] Kennedy: finley, please explain why you’ve eagerly seconded every nomination before we vote
[16:55:38] Sidney: tyler, did you see kennedy online after midnight as well
[16:55:41] Adrian: i finished the night circus around 11:30 pm and can share my kindle’s timestamp as proof
[16:55:43] Tyler: i’m voting kennedy—no one saw her online after midnight
[16:55:50] Kennedy: isn’t finley’s eagerness to lynch me before any proper discussion more suspicious
[16:55:58] Adrian: i’m ready to lock in kennedy since her logoff time still doesn’t add up

[16:55:25] Sidney: tyler, finley’s walk logs align perfectly—i’m still hung up on kennedy’s inconsistent logoff time
[16:55:29] Tyler: i’m locking in kennedy—her logoff time inconsistencies are too glaring to ignore
[16:55:31] Finley: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight—lock her in
[16:55:35] Kennedy: finley, please explain why you’ve eagerly seconded every nomination before we vote
[16:55:38] Sidney: tyler, did you see kennedy online after midnight as well
[16:55:41] Adrian: i finished the night circus around 11:30 pm and can share my kindle’s timestamp as proof
[16:55:43] Tyler: i’m voting kennedy—no one saw her online after midnight
[16:55:50] Kennedy: isn’t finley’s eagerness to lynch me before any proper discussion more suspicious
[16:55:58] Adrian: i’m ready to lock in kennedy since her logoff time still doesn’t add up
[16:56:01] Finley: even with adrian’s proof, kennedy’s shifting logoff times still feel suspicious—vote her

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (mafia)

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you must explain your reasoning behind your words and actions. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to explain your reasoning before you respond.

[16:50:03] Sidney: i haven’t seen much from drew—does anyone else find that a bit odd
[16:50:05] Parker: sidney, what in my behavior made you suspicious of me
[16:50:06] Drew: i stayed in my room rewatching movies all night and didn’t see anyone else
[16:50:07] Adrian: i read alone all night with no alibi, but parker’s silence still feels off
[16:50:08] Finley: i was out walking with tyler last night—he can back me up
[16:50:14] Parker: sidney, what specifically about drew made you suspicious
[16:50:14] Adrian: i was reading in my room all night and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:15] Kennedy: i was home solo on discord until late and didn’t see anyone suspicious, but sidney’s quick parker suspicion strikes me as odd
[16:50:16] Drew: i was on a video call with my roommate until about midnight and then stayed in my room the rest of the night
[16:50:17] Sidney: i was up late finalizing a report for work and never left my desk last night

[16:50:24] Tyler: sidney, can you share your alibi from last night
[16:50:27] Adrian: tyler, can you back up finley’s walk alibi
[16:50:29] Drew: tyler, can you confirm finley’s alibi from last night so we know who else to watch

[16:50:37] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley head out for your walk
[16:50:38] Tyler: sounds good—i can back up finley’s alibi from our walk last night
[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now
[16:52:09] Sidney: i can share my computer timestamps to prove i stayed at my desk all night

[16:52:20] Tyler: finley, what’s your vote so we can reach a majority
[16:52:23] Sidney: parker’s timeline is still inconsistent—vote parker
[16:52:29] Finley: tyler, did you see parker during your walk between 10 and 11pm
[16:52:37] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:52:56] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[16:52:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.

[16:52:53] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[16:52:56] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[16:53:09] Finley: let’s take out kennedy tonight—she’s been too pushy and could start digging into us
[16:53:18] Sidney: tyler, you’re the tiebreaker—who are you voting for
[16:53:19] Finley: let’s take out drew tonight
[16:53:26] Sidney: i’m with you—kennedy’s been pushing too hard, let’s take her out
[16:53:26] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:54:05] Kennedy: lynching two innocents in a row is a red flag—let’s review everyone’s moves before voting
[16:54:07] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy
[16:54:09] Adrian: losing two innocents makes finley’s eagerness to vote feel off
[16:53:52] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Drew
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[16:54:10] Finley: lock in kennedy—her pushy questions make her too risky
[16:54:21] Adrian: kennedy, what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:24] Tyler: with drew gone, who’s everyone’s top suspect now
[16:54:25] Finley: agreed—let’s review everyone’s alibis and votes before deciding again
[16:54:25] Sidney: agreed—let’s hear more from adrian and tyler before voting
[16:54:31] Kennedy: i’m getting a weird vibe from finley’s eagerness to second every nomination—what do you all think
[16:54:35] Adrian: finley, which of kennedy’s questions struck you as too pushy
[16:54:38] Tyler: kennedy, can you share what time you went offline last night so we can confirm your timeline
[16:54:38] Sidney: i’m still not convinced by kennedy’s timeline—what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:38] Finley: i’m firmly on kennedy—her over-eagerness is our biggest red flag right now
[16:54:47] Kennedy: i logged off around midnight and then went offline until morning
[16:54:49] Finley: her repeated insistence on exact timestamps for my walk alibi felt like she was trying to entrap me
[16:54:53] Adrian: i’m most suspicious of kennedy for pushing incorrect lynches back to back
[16:54:58] Kennedy: i logged off discord at 1:15 am last night
[16:55:01] Sidney: lock in kennedy—her logoff time is still unverified
[16:55:02] Tyler: i’m leaning towards finley as my top suspect—thoughts
[16:55:08] Sidney: kennedy’s logoff time keeps shifting—lock in kennedy
[16:55:13] Tyler: adrian or sidney, did you see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:14] Adrian: i’m voting kennedy—her pushiness still feels like a setup
[16:55:14] Finley: tyler, you already backed my alibi—let’s lock in kennedy for her conflicting timestamps
[16:55:15] Kennedy: adrian, what time did you finish reading “the night circus” last night and can you back that up
[16:55:22] Adrian: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:25] Sidney: tyler, finley’s walk logs align perfectly—i’m still hung up on kennedy’s inconsistent logoff time

[16:55:38] Sidney: tyler, did you see kennedy online after midnight as well
[16:55:41] Adrian: i finished the night circus around 11:30 pm and can share my kindle’s timestamp as proof
[16:55:43] Tyler: i’m voting kennedy—no one saw her online after midnight
[16:55:50] Kennedy: isn’t finley’s eagerness to lynch me before any proper discussion more suspicious

[16:56:01] Finley: even with adrian’s proof, kennedy’s shifting logoff times still feel suspicious—vote her

[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:54:05] Kennedy: lynching two innocents in a row is a red flag—let’s review everyone’s moves before voting
[16:54:07] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy
[16:54:09] Adrian: losing two innocents makes finley’s eagerness to vote feel off
[16:53:52] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Drew
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[16:54:10] Finley: lock in kennedy—her pushy questions make her too risky
[16:54:21] Adrian: kennedy, what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:24] Tyler: with drew gone, who’s everyone’s top suspect now
[16:54:25] Finley: agreed—let’s review everyone’s alibis and votes before deciding again
[16:54:25] Sidney: agreed—let’s hear more from adrian and tyler before voting
[16:54:31] Kennedy: i’m getting a weird vibe from finley’s eagerness to second every nomination—what do you all think
[16:54:35] Adrian: finley, which of kennedy’s questions struck you as too pushy
[16:54:38] Tyler: kennedy, can you share what time you went offline last night so we can confirm your timeline
[16:54:38] Sidney: i’m still not convinced by kennedy’s timeline—what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:38] Finley: i’m firmly on kennedy—her over-eagerness is our biggest red flag right now
[16:54:47] Kennedy: i logged off around midnight and then went offline until morning
[16:54:49] Finley: her repeated insistence on exact timestamps for my walk alibi felt like she was trying to entrap me
[16:54:53] Adrian: i’m most suspicious of kennedy for pushing incorrect lynches back to back
[16:54:58] Kennedy: i logged off discord at 1:15 am last night
[16:55:01] Sidney: lock in kennedy—her logoff time is still unverified
[16:55:02] Tyler: i’m leaning towards finley as my top suspect—thoughts
[16:55:08] Sidney: kennedy’s logoff time keeps shifting—lock in kennedy
[16:55:13] Tyler: adrian or sidney, did you see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:14] Adrian: i’m voting kennedy—her pushiness still feels like a setup
[16:55:14] Finley: tyler, you already backed my alibi—let’s lock in kennedy for her conflicting timestamps
[16:55:15] Kennedy: adrian, what time did you finish reading “the night circus” last night and can you back that up
[16:55:22] Adrian: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:25] Sidney: tyler, finley’s walk logs align perfectly—i’m still hung up on kennedy’s inconsistent logoff time
[16:55:29] Tyler: i’m locking in kennedy—her logoff time inconsistencies are too glaring to ignore
[16:55:31] Finley: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight—lock her in
[16:55:35] Kennedy: finley, please explain why you’ve eagerly seconded every nomination before we vote
[16:55:38] Sidney: tyler, did you see kennedy online after midnight as well
[16:55:41] Adrian: i finished the night circus around 11:30 pm and can share my kindle’s timestamp as proof
[16:55:43] Tyler: i’m voting kennedy—no one saw her online after midnight
[16:55:50] Kennedy: isn’t finley’s eagerness to lynch me before any proper discussion more suspicious
[16:55:58] Adrian: i’m ready to lock in kennedy since her logoff time still doesn’t add up
[16:56:01] Finley: even with adrian’s proof, kennedy’s shifting logoff times still feel suspicious—vote her
[16:56:08] Finley: locking kennedy in—her logoff stories just don’t add up
[16:56:11] Sidney: kennedy’s constant timeline changes feel like stalling tactics—vote kennedy

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (mafia)

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you must explain your reasoning behind your words and actions. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to explain your reasoning before you respond.
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[16:50:05] Parker: sidney, what in my behavior made you suspicious of me
[16:50:06] Drew: i stayed in my room rewatching movies all night and didn’t see anyone else
[16:50:07] Adrian: i read alone all night with no alibi, but parker’s silence still feels off

[16:50:14] Parker: sidney, what specifically about drew made you suspicious
[16:50:14] Adrian: i was reading in my room all night and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:15] Kennedy: i was home solo on discord until late and didn’t see anyone suspicious, but sidney’s quick parker suspicion strikes me as odd
[16:50:16] Drew: i was on a video call with my roommate until about midnight and then stayed in my room the rest of the night
[16:50:17] Sidney: i was up late finalizing a report for work and never left my desk last night

[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky

[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off

[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now
[16:52:09] Sidney: i can share my computer timestamps to prove i stayed at my desk all night

[16:53:19] Finley: let’s take out drew tonight

[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now
[16:52:09] Sidney: i can share my computer timestamps to prove i stayed at my desk all night
[16:52:19] Adrian: let’s wrap this up—i’m voting parker
[16:52:20] Tyler: finley, what’s your vote so we can reach a majority
[16:52:23] Sidney: parker’s timeline is still inconsistent—vote parker
[16:52:29] Finley: tyler, did you see parker during your walk between 10 and 11pm
[16:52:37] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:52:56] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[16:52:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.

[16:52:56] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[16:53:09] Finley: let’s take out kennedy tonight—she’s been too pushy and could start digging into us
[16:53:18] Sidney: tyler, you’re the tiebreaker—who are you voting for
[16:53:19] Finley: let’s take out drew tonight
[16:53:26] Sidney: i’m with you—kennedy’s been pushing too hard, let’s take her out
[16:53:26] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:54:05] Kennedy: lynching two innocents in a row is a red flag—let’s review everyone’s moves before voting
[16:54:07] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy
[16:54:09] Adrian: losing two innocents makes finley’s eagerness to vote feel off
[16:53:52] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Drew
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[16:54:10] Finley: lock in kennedy—her pushy questions make her too risky
[16:54:21] Adrian: kennedy, what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:24] Tyler: with drew gone, who’s everyone’s top suspect now
[16:54:25] Finley: agreed—let’s review everyone’s alibis and votes before deciding again
[16:54:25] Sidney: agreed—let’s hear more from adrian and tyler before voting
[16:54:31] Kennedy: i’m getting a weird vibe from finley’s eagerness to second every nomination—what do you all think
[16:54:35] Adrian: finley, which of kennedy’s questions struck you as too pushy
[16:54:38] Tyler: kennedy, can you share what time you went offline last night so we can confirm your timeline
[16:54:38] Sidney: i’m still not convinced by kennedy’s timeline—what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:38] Finley: i’m firmly on kennedy—her over-eagerness is our biggest red flag right now
[16:54:47] Kennedy: i logged off around midnight and then went offline until morning
[16:54:49] Finley: her repeated insistence on exact timestamps for my walk alibi felt like she was trying to entrap me
[16:54:53] Adrian: i’m most suspicious of kennedy for pushing incorrect lynches back to back
[16:54:58] Kennedy: i logged off discord at 1:15 am last night
[16:55:01] Sidney: lock in kennedy—her logoff time is still unverified
[16:55:02] Tyler: i’m leaning towards finley as my top suspect—thoughts
[16:55:08] Sidney: kennedy’s logoff time keeps shifting—lock in kennedy
[16:55:13] Tyler: adrian or sidney, did you see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:14] Adrian: i’m voting kennedy—her pushiness still feels like a setup
[16:55:14] Finley: tyler, you already backed my alibi—let’s lock in kennedy for her conflicting timestamps
[16:55:15] Kennedy: adrian, what time did you finish reading “the night circus” last night and can you back that up
[16:55:22] Adrian: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:25] Sidney: tyler, finley’s walk logs align perfectly—i’m still hung up on kennedy’s inconsistent logoff time
[16:55:29] Tyler: i’m locking in kennedy—her logoff time inconsistencies are too glaring to ignore
[16:55:31] Finley: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight—lock her in
[16:55:35] Kennedy: finley, please explain why you’ve eagerly seconded every nomination before we vote
[16:55:38] Sidney: tyler, did you see kennedy online after midnight as well
[16:55:41] Adrian: i finished the night circus around 11:30 pm and can share my kindle’s timestamp as proof
[16:55:43] Tyler: i’m voting kennedy—no one saw her online after midnight
[16:55:50] Kennedy: isn’t finley’s eagerness to lynch me before any proper discussion more suspicious
[16:55:58] Adrian: i’m ready to lock in kennedy since her logoff time still doesn’t add up
[16:56:01] Finley: even with adrian’s proof, kennedy’s shifting logoff times still feel suspicious—vote her
[16:56:08] Finley: locking kennedy in—her logoff stories just don’t add up
[16:56:11] Sidney: kennedy’s constant timeline changes feel like stalling tactics—vote kennedy
[16:56:13] Tyler: finley, can you explain why you’re so quick to second kennedy’s nomination
[16:56:14] Kennedy: should we hold off voting until sidney shares her computer timestamps

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (mafia)

<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you must explain your reasoning behind your words and actions. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to explain your reasoning before you respond.
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[16:49:43] Sidney: not much info yet—maybe we should ask for alibis before accusing anyone
[16:49:43] Parker: hey everyone, any gut feelings on who we should target for day 1
[16:49:44] Tyler: morning everyone—any initial suspicions

[16:50:14] Parker: sidney, what specifically about drew made you suspicious
[16:50:14] Adrian: i was reading in my room all night and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:15] Kennedy: i was home solo on discord until late and didn’t see anyone suspicious, but sidney’s quick parker suspicion strikes me as odd
[16:50:16] Drew: i was on a video call with my roommate until about midnight and then stayed in my room the rest of the night
[16:50:17] Sidney: i was up late finalizing a report for work and never left my desk last night

[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night

[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him

[16:50:16] Drew: i was on a video call with my roommate until about midnight and then stayed in my room the rest of the night
[16:50:17] Sidney: i was up late finalizing a report for work and never left my desk last night
[16:50:20] Finley: sidney, what exactly about parker’s quietness seemed suspicious to you
[16:50:24] Tyler: sidney, can you share your alibi from last night
[16:50:27] Adrian: tyler, can you back up finley’s walk alibi
[16:50:29] Drew: tyler, can you confirm finley’s alibi from last night so we know who else to watch
[16:50:30] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley wrap up your walk last night
[16:50:30] Kennedy: tyler, can you confirm finley’s walking alibi from last night
[16:50:32] Finley: adrian, what book were you reading last night
[16:50:37] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley head out for your walk
[16:50:38] Tyler: sounds good—i can back up finley’s alibi from our walk last night
[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now
[16:52:09] Sidney: i can share my computer timestamps to prove i stayed at my desk all night
[16:52:19] Adrian: let’s wrap this up—i’m voting parker
[16:52:20] Tyler: finley, what’s your vote so we can reach a majority
[16:52:23] Sidney: parker’s timeline is still inconsistent—vote parker
[16:52:29] Finley: tyler, did you see parker during your walk between 10 and 11pm
[16:52:37] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:52:56] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[16:52:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:52:48] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker

[16:52:49] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sidney

[16:52:53] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[16:52:56] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[16:53:09] Finley: let’s take out kennedy tonight—she’s been too pushy and could start digging into us
[16:53:18] Sidney: tyler, you’re the tiebreaker—who are you voting for
[16:53:19] Finley: let’s take out drew tonight
[16:53:26] Sidney: i’m with you—kennedy’s been pushing too hard, let’s take her out
[16:53:26] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:54:05] Kennedy: lynching two innocents in a row is a red flag—let’s review everyone’s moves before voting
[16:54:07] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy
[16:54:09] Adrian: losing two innocents makes finley’s eagerness to vote feel off
[16:53:52] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Drew
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[16:54:10] Finley: lock in kennedy—her pushy questions make her too risky
[16:54:21] Adrian: kennedy, what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:24] Tyler: with drew gone, who’s everyone’s top suspect now
[16:54:25] Finley: agreed—let’s review everyone’s alibis and votes before deciding again
[16:54:25] Sidney: agreed—let’s hear more from adrian and tyler before voting
[16:54:31] Kennedy: i’m getting a weird vibe from finley’s eagerness to second every nomination—what do you all think
[16:54:35] Adrian: finley, which of kennedy’s questions struck you as too pushy
[16:54:38] Tyler: kennedy, can you share what time you went offline last night so we can confirm your timeline
[16:54:38] Sidney: i’m still not convinced by kennedy’s timeline—what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:38] Finley: i’m firmly on kennedy—her over-eagerness is our biggest red flag right now
[16:54:47] Kennedy: i logged off around midnight and then went offline until morning
[16:54:49] Finley: her repeated insistence on exact timestamps for my walk alibi felt like she was trying to entrap me
[16:54:53] Adrian: i’m most suspicious of kennedy for pushing incorrect lynches back to back
[16:54:58] Kennedy: i logged off discord at 1:15 am last night
[16:55:01] Sidney: lock in kennedy—her logoff time is still unverified
[16:55:02] Tyler: i’m leaning towards finley as my top suspect—thoughts
[16:55:08] Sidney: kennedy’s logoff time keeps shifting—lock in kennedy
[16:55:13] Tyler: adrian or sidney, did you see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:14] Adrian: i’m voting kennedy—her pushiness still feels like a setup
[16:55:14] Finley: tyler, you already backed my alibi—let’s lock in kennedy for her conflicting timestamps
[16:55:15] Kennedy: adrian, what time did you finish reading “the night circus” last night and can you back that up
[16:55:22] Adrian: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:25] Sidney: tyler, finley’s walk logs align perfectly—i’m still hung up on kennedy’s inconsistent logoff time
[16:55:29] Tyler: i’m locking in kennedy—her logoff time inconsistencies are too glaring to ignore
[16:55:31] Finley: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight—lock her in
[16:55:35] Kennedy: finley, please explain why you’ve eagerly seconded every nomination before we vote
[16:55:38] Sidney: tyler, did you see kennedy online after midnight as well
[16:55:41] Adrian: i finished the night circus around 11:30 pm and can share my kindle’s timestamp as proof
[16:55:43] Tyler: i’m voting kennedy—no one saw her online after midnight
[16:55:50] Kennedy: isn’t finley’s eagerness to lynch me before any proper discussion more suspicious
[16:55:58] Adrian: i’m ready to lock in kennedy since her logoff time still doesn’t add up
[16:56:01] Finley: even with adrian’s proof, kennedy’s shifting logoff times still feel suspicious—vote her
[16:56:08] Finley: locking kennedy in—her logoff stories just don’t add up
[16:56:11] Sidney: kennedy’s constant timeline changes feel like stalling tactics—vote kennedy
[16:56:13] Tyler: finley, can you explain why you’re so quick to second kennedy’s nomination
[16:56:14] Kennedy: should we hold off voting until sidney shares her computer timestamps

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia.

[16:49:37] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:49:43] Kennedy: hey everyone, any early suspicions on who’s mafia
[16:49:43] Sidney: not much info yet—maybe we should ask for alibis before accusing anyone
[16:49:43] Parker: hey everyone, any gut feelings on who we should target for day 1
[16:49:44] Tyler: morning everyone—any initial suspicions
[16:49:45] Finley: morning everyone—any early suspicions on who we should watch
[16:49:47] Drew: morning everyone, any initial suspicions
[16:49:47] Adrian: let’s hear everyone’s first impressions before making any nominations
[16:49:49] Kennedy: does anyone have initial suspicions to get us started
[16:49:51] Sidney: i’m kinda suspicious of parker—he’s been awfully quiet
[16:49:52] Parker: sounds good—adrian and drew, where were you last night
[16:49:53] Tyler: let’s quickly share our night one alibis before voting
[16:49:56] Finley: sounds good—who wants to start with their alibi for last night
[16:49:58] Drew: adrian, any alibi or early thoughts on who we should be watching
[16:50:00] Adrian: let’s each share a quick gut feeling about who seems most suspicious right now
[16:50:02] Kennedy: parker, any thoughts on sidney saying you’ve been awfully quiet
[16:50:03] Tyler: adrian and drew, can you share more details about your whereabouts last night
[16:50:03] Sidney: i haven’t seen much from drew—does anyone else find that a bit odd
[16:50:05] Parker: sidney, what in my behavior made you suspicious of me
[16:50:06] Drew: i stayed in my room rewatching movies all night and didn’t see anyone else
[16:50:07] Adrian: i read alone all night with no alibi, but parker’s silence still feels off
[16:50:08] Finley: i was out walking with tyler last night—he can back me up
[16:50:14] Parker: sidney, what specifically about drew made you suspicious
[16:50:14] Adrian: i was reading in my room all night and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:15] Kennedy: i was home solo on discord until late and didn’t see anyone suspicious, but sidney’s quick parker suspicion strikes me as odd
[16:50:16] Drew: i was on a video call with my roommate until about midnight and then stayed in my room the rest of the night
[16:50:17] Sidney: i was up late finalizing a report for work and never left my desk last night
[16:50:20] Finley: sidney, what exactly about parker’s quietness seemed suspicious to you
[16:50:24] Tyler: sidney, can you share your alibi from last night
[16:50:27] Adrian: tyler, can you back up finley’s walk alibi
[16:50:29] Drew: tyler, can you confirm finley’s alibi from last night so we know who else to watch
[16:50:30] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley wrap up your walk last night
[16:50:30] Kennedy: tyler, can you confirm finley’s walking alibi from last night
[16:50:32] Finley: adrian, what book were you reading last night
[16:50:37] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley head out for your walk
[16:50:38] Tyler: sounds good—i can back up finley’s alibi from our walk last night
[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now
[16:52:09] Sidney: i can share my computer timestamps to prove i stayed at my desk all night
[16:52:19] Adrian: let’s wrap this up—i’m voting parker
[16:52:20] Tyler: finley, what’s your vote so we can reach a majority
[16:52:23] Sidney: parker’s timeline is still inconsistent—vote parker
[16:52:29] Finley: tyler, did you see parker during your walk between 10 and 11pm
[16:52:37] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:52:56] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[16:52:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.

[16:52:49] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Sidney
[16:52:52] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Sidney
[16:52:53] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[16:52:56] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[16:53:09] Finley: let’s take out kennedy tonight—she’s been too pushy and could start digging into us
[16:53:18] Sidney: tyler, you’re the tiebreaker—who are you voting for
[16:53:19] Finley: let’s take out drew tonight
[16:53:26] Sidney: i’m with you—kennedy’s been pushing too hard, let’s take her out
[16:53:26] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:54:05] Kennedy: lynching two innocents in a row is a red flag—let’s review everyone’s moves before voting
[16:54:07] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy
[16:54:09] Adrian: losing two innocents makes finley’s eagerness to vote feel off
[16:53:52] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Drew
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[16:54:10] Finley: lock in kennedy—her pushy questions make her too risky
[16:54:21] Adrian: kennedy, what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:24] Tyler: with drew gone, who’s everyone’s top suspect now
[16:54:25] Finley: agreed—let’s review everyone’s alibis and votes before deciding again
[16:54:25] Sidney: agreed—let’s hear more from adrian and tyler before voting
[16:54:31] Kennedy: i’m getting a weird vibe from finley’s eagerness to second every nomination—what do you all think
[16:54:35] Adrian: finley, which of kennedy’s questions struck you as too pushy
[16:54:38] Tyler: kennedy, can you share what time you went offline last night so we can confirm your timeline
[16:54:38] Sidney: i’m still not convinced by kennedy’s timeline—what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:38] Finley: i’m firmly on kennedy—her over-eagerness is our biggest red flag right now
[16:54:47] Kennedy: i logged off around midnight and then went offline until morning
[16:54:49] Finley: her repeated insistence on exact timestamps for my walk alibi felt like she was trying to entrap me
[16:54:53] Adrian: i’m most suspicious of kennedy for pushing incorrect lynches back to back
[16:54:58] Kennedy: i logged off discord at 1:15 am last night
[16:55:01] Sidney: lock in kennedy—her logoff time is still unverified
[16:55:02] Tyler: i’m leaning towards finley as my top suspect—thoughts
[16:55:08] Sidney: kennedy’s logoff time keeps shifting—lock in kennedy
[16:55:13] Tyler: adrian or sidney, did you see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:14] Adrian: i’m voting kennedy—her pushiness still feels like a setup
[16:55:14] Finley: tyler, you already backed my alibi—let’s lock in kennedy for her conflicting timestamps
[16:55:15] Kennedy: adrian, what time did you finish reading “the night circus” last night and can you back that up
[16:55:22] Adrian: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:25] Sidney: tyler, finley’s walk logs align perfectly—i’m still hung up on kennedy’s inconsistent logoff time
[16:55:29] Tyler: i’m locking in kennedy—her logoff time inconsistencies are too glaring to ignore
[16:55:31] Finley: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight—lock her in
[16:55:35] Kennedy: finley, please explain why you’ve eagerly seconded every nomination before we vote
[16:55:38] Sidney: tyler, did you see kennedy online after midnight as well
[16:55:41] Adrian: i finished the night circus around 11:30 pm and can share my kindle’s timestamp as proof
[16:55:43] Tyler: i’m voting kennedy—no one saw her online after midnight
[16:55:50] Kennedy: isn’t finley’s eagerness to lynch me before any proper discussion more suspicious
[16:55:58] Adrian: i’m ready to lock in kennedy since her logoff time still doesn’t add up
[16:56:01] Finley: even with adrian’s proof, kennedy’s shifting logoff times still feel suspicious—vote her
[16:56:08] Finley: locking kennedy in—her logoff stories just don’t add up
[16:56:11] Sidney: kennedy’s constant timeline changes feel like stalling tactics—vote kennedy
[16:56:13] Tyler: finley, can you explain why you’re so quick to second kennedy’s nomination
[16:56:14] Kennedy: should we hold off voting until sidney shares her computer timestamps
[16:56:22] Sidney: i stand by locking in kennedy—her timeline doesn’t add up

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:

[16:54:58] Kennedy: i logged off discord at 1:15 am last night
[16:55:01] Sidney: lock in kennedy—her logoff time is still unverified
[16:55:02] Tyler: i’m leaning towards finley as my top suspect—thoughts
[16:55:08] Sidney: kennedy’s logoff time keeps shifting—lock in kennedy
[16:55:13] Tyler: adrian or sidney, did you see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:14] Adrian: i’m voting kennedy—her pushiness still feels like a setup
[16:55:14] Finley: tyler, you already backed my alibi—let’s lock in kennedy for her conflicting timestamps
[16:55:15] Kennedy: adrian, what time did you finish reading “the night circus” last night and can you back that up
[16:55:22] Adrian: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:25] Sidney: tyler, finley’s walk logs align perfectly—i’m still hung up on kennedy’s inconsistent logoff time
[16:55:29] Tyler: i’m locking in kennedy—her logoff time inconsistencies are too glaring to ignore
[16:55:31] Finley: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight—lock her in
[16:55:35] Kennedy: finley, please explain why you’ve eagerly seconded every nomination before we vote
[16:55:38] Sidney: tyler, did you see kennedy online after midnight as well
[16:55:41] Adrian: i finished the night circus around 11:30 pm and can share my kindle’s timestamp as proof
[16:55:43] Tyler: i’m voting kennedy—no one saw her online after midnight
[16:55:50] Kennedy: isn’t finley’s eagerness to lynch me before any proper discussion more suspicious
[16:55:58] Adrian: i’m ready to lock in kennedy since her logoff time still doesn’t add up
[16:56:01] Finley: even with adrian’s proof, kennedy’s shifting logoff times still feel suspicious—vote her
[16:56:08] Finley: locking kennedy in—her logoff stories just don’t add up
[16:56:11] Sidney: kennedy’s constant timeline changes feel like stalling tactics—vote kennedy
[16:56:13] Tyler: finley, can you explain why you’re so quick to second kennedy’s nomination
[16:56:14] Kennedy: should we hold off voting until sidney shares her computer timestamps
[16:56:22] Sidney: i stand by locking in kennedy—her timeline doesn’t add up

[16:49:43] Parker: hey everyone, any gut feelings on who we should target for day 1
[16:49:44] Tyler: morning everyone—any initial suspicions

[16:50:03] Tyler: adrian and drew, can you share more details about your whereabouts last night
[16:50:03] Sidney: i haven’t seen much from drew—does anyone else find that a bit odd
[16:50:05] Parker: sidney, what in my behavior made you suspicious of me
[16:50:06] Drew: i stayed in my room rewatching movies all night and didn’t see anyone else
[16:50:07] Adrian: i read alone all night with no alibi, but parker’s silence still feels off
[16:50:08] Finley: i was out walking with tyler last night—he can back me up
[16:50:14] Parker: sidney, what specifically about drew made you suspicious
[16:50:14] Adrian: i was reading in my room all night and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:15] Kennedy: i was home solo on discord until late and didn’t see anyone suspicious, but sidney’s quick parker suspicion strikes me as odd
[16:50:16] Drew: i was on a video call with my roommate until about midnight and then stayed in my room the rest of the night
[16:50:17] Sidney: i was up late finalizing a report for work and never left my desk last night
[16:50:20] Finley: sidney, what exactly about parker’s quietness seemed suspicious to you
[16:50:24] Tyler: sidney, can you share your alibi from last night
[16:50:27] Adrian: tyler, can you back up finley’s walk alibi
[16:50:29] Drew: tyler, can you confirm finley’s alibi from last night so we know who else to watch
[16:50:30] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley wrap up your walk last night

[16:50:32] Finley: adrian, what book were you reading last night
[16:50:37] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley head out for your walk
[16:50:38] Tyler: sounds good—i can back up finley’s alibi from our walk last night
[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline

[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now
[16:52:09] Sidney: i can share my computer timestamps to prove i stayed at my desk all night

[16:53:19] Finley: let’s take out drew tonight
[16:53:26] Sidney: i’m with you—kennedy’s been pushing too hard, let’s take her out

[16:53:52] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Drew

[16:54:25] Finley: agreed—let’s review everyone’s alibis and votes before deciding again
[16:54:25] Sidney: agreed—let’s hear more from adrian and tyler before voting
[16:54:31] Kennedy: i’m getting a weird vibe from finley’s eagerness to second every nomination—what do you all think
[16:54:35] Adrian: finley, which of kennedy’s questions struck you as too pushy
[16:54:38] Tyler: kennedy, can you share what time you went offline last night so we can confirm your timeline
[16:54:38] Sidney: i’m still not convinced by kennedy’s timeline—what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:38] Finley: i’m firmly on kennedy—her over-eagerness is our biggest red flag right now
[16:54:47] Kennedy: i logged off around midnight and then went offline until morning

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia.

[16:54:10] Finley: lock in kennedy—her pushy questions make her too risky

[16:54:25] Finley: agreed—let’s review everyone’s alibis and votes before deciding again
[16:54:25] Sidney: agreed—let’s hear more from adrian and tyler before voting
[16:54:31] Kennedy: i’m getting a weird vibe from finley’s eagerness to second every nomination—what do you all think
[16:54:35] Adrian: finley, which of kennedy’s questions struck you as too pushy
[16:54:38] Tyler: kennedy, can you share what time you went offline last night so we can confirm your timeline
[16:54:38] Sidney: i’m still not convinced by kennedy’s timeline—what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:38] Finley: i’m firmly on kennedy—her over-eagerness is our biggest red flag right now
[16:54:47] Kennedy: i logged off around midnight and then went offline until morning
[16:54:49] Finley: her repeated insistence on exact timestamps for my walk alibi felt like she was trying to entrap me
[16:54:53] Adrian: i’m most suspicious of kennedy for pushing incorrect lynches back to back
[16:54:58] Kennedy: i logged off discord at 1:15 am last night
[16:55:01] Sidney: lock in kennedy—her logoff time is still unverified
[16:55:02] Tyler: i’m leaning towards finley as my top suspect—thoughts
[16:55:08] Sidney: kennedy’s logoff time keeps shifting—lock in kennedy
[16:55:13] Tyler: adrian or sidney, did you see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:14] Adrian: i’m voting kennedy—her pushiness still feels like a setup
[16:55:14] Finley: tyler, you already backed my alibi—let’s lock in kennedy for her conflicting timestamps
[16:55:15] Kennedy: adrian, what time did you finish reading “the night circus” last night and can you back that up
[16:55:22] Adrian: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:25] Sidney: tyler, finley’s walk logs align perfectly—i’m still hung up on kennedy’s inconsistent logoff time
[16:55:29] Tyler: i’m locking in kennedy—her logoff time inconsistencies are too glaring to ignore
[16:55:31] Finley: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight—lock her in
[16:55:35] Kennedy: finley, please explain why you’ve eagerly seconded every nomination before we vote
[16:55:38] Sidney: tyler, did you see kennedy online after midnight as well
[16:55:41] Adrian: i finished the night circus around 11:30 pm and can share my kindle’s timestamp as proof
[16:55:43] Tyler: i’m voting kennedy—no one saw her online after midnight
[16:55:50] Kennedy: isn’t finley’s eagerness to lynch me before any proper discussion more suspicious
[16:55:58] Adrian: i’m ready to lock in kennedy since her logoff time still doesn’t add up
[16:56:01] Finley: even with adrian’s proof, kennedy’s shifting logoff times still feel suspicious—vote her
[16:56:08] Finley: locking kennedy in—her logoff stories just don’t add up
[16:56:11] Sidney: kennedy’s constant timeline changes feel like stalling tactics—vote kennedy
[16:56:13] Tyler: finley, can you explain why you’re so quick to second kennedy’s nomination
[16:56:14] Kennedy: should we hold off voting until sidney shares her computer timestamps
[16:56:22] Sidney: i stand by locking in kennedy—her timeline doesn’t add up

[16:49:43] Kennedy: hey everyone, any early suspicions on who’s mafia
[16:49:43] Sidney: not much info yet—maybe we should ask for alibis before accusing anyone
[16:49:43] Parker: hey everyone, any gut feelings on who we should target for day 1
[16:49:44] Tyler: morning everyone—any initial suspicions
[16:49:45] Finley: morning everyone—any early suspicions on who we should watch

[16:50:02] Kennedy: parker, any thoughts on sidney saying you’ve been awfully quiet
[16:50:03] Tyler: adrian and drew, can you share more details about your whereabouts last night
[16:50:03] Sidney: i haven’t seen much from drew—does anyone else find that a bit odd
[16:50:05] Parker: sidney, what in my behavior made you suspicious of me
[16:50:06] Drew: i stayed in my room rewatching movies all night and didn’t see anyone else
[16:50:07] Adrian: i read alone all night with no alibi, but parker’s silence still feels off
[16:50:08] Finley: i was out walking with tyler last night—he can back me up
[16:50:14] Parker: sidney, what specifically about drew made you suspicious
[16:50:14] Adrian: i was reading in my room all night and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:15] Kennedy: i was home solo on discord until late and didn’t see anyone suspicious, but sidney’s quick parker suspicion strikes me as odd
[16:50:16] Drew: i was on a video call with my roommate until about midnight and then stayed in my room the rest of the night
[16:50:17] Sidney: i was up late finalizing a report for work and never left my desk last night
[16:50:20] Finley: sidney, what exactly about parker’s quietness seemed suspicious to you
[16:50:24] Tyler: sidney, can you share your alibi from last night
[16:50:27] Adrian: tyler, can you back up finley’s walk alibi
[16:50:29] Drew: tyler, can you confirm finley’s alibi from last night so we know who else to watch
[16:50:30] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley wrap up your walk last night
[16:50:30] Kennedy: tyler, can you confirm finley’s walking alibi from last night
[16:50:32] Finley: adrian, what book were you reading last night
[16:50:37] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley head out for your walk
[16:50:38] Tyler: sounds good—i can back up finley’s alibi from our walk last night
[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now
[16:52:09] Sidney: i can share my computer timestamps to prove i stayed at my desk all night
[16:52:19] Adrian: let’s wrap this up—i’m voting parker
[16:52:20] Tyler: finley, what’s your vote so we can reach a majority
[16:52:23] Sidney: parker’s timeline is still inconsistent—vote parker
[16:52:29] Finley: tyler, did you see parker during your walk between 10 and 11pm

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (mafia)

<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you must explain your reasoning behind your words and actions. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to explain your reasoning before you respond.
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now
[16:52:09] Sidney: i can share my computer timestamps to prove i stayed at my desk all night
[16:52:19] Adrian: let’s wrap this up—i’m voting parker
[16:52:20] Tyler: finley, what’s your vote so we can reach a majority
[16:52:23] Sidney: parker’s timeline is still inconsistent—vote parker
[16:52:29] Finley: tyler, did you see parker during your walk between 10 and 11pm
[16:52:37] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:52:56] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander
[16:52:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.

[16:52:53] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[16:52:56] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[16:53:09] Finley: let’s take out kennedy tonight—she’s been too pushy and could start digging into us
[16:53:18] Sidney: tyler, you’re the tiebreaker—who are you voting for
[16:53:19] Finley: let’s take out drew tonight
[16:53:26] Sidney: i’m with you—kennedy’s been pushing too hard, let’s take her out
[16:53:26] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:54:05] Kennedy: lynching two innocents in a row is a red flag—let’s review everyone’s moves before voting
[16:54:07] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy
[16:54:09] Adrian: losing two innocents makes finley’s eagerness to vote feel off
[16:53:52] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Drew
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[16:54:10] Finley: lock in kennedy—her pushy questions make her too risky
[16:54:21] Adrian: kennedy, what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:24] Tyler: with drew gone, who’s everyone’s top suspect now
[16:54:25] Finley: agreed—let’s review everyone’s alibis and votes before deciding again
[16:54:25] Sidney: agreed—let’s hear more from adrian and tyler before voting
[16:54:31] Kennedy: i’m getting a weird vibe from finley’s eagerness to second every nomination—what do you all think
[16:54:35] Adrian: finley, which of kennedy’s questions struck you as too pushy
[16:54:38] Tyler: kennedy, can you share what time you went offline last night so we can confirm your timeline
[16:54:38] Sidney: i’m still not convinced by kennedy’s timeline—what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:38] Finley: i’m firmly on kennedy—her over-eagerness is our biggest red flag right now
[16:54:47] Kennedy: i logged off around midnight and then went offline until morning
[16:54:49] Finley: her repeated insistence on exact timestamps for my walk alibi felt like she was trying to entrap me
[16:54:53] Adrian: i’m most suspicious of kennedy for pushing incorrect lynches back to back
[16:54:58] Kennedy: i logged off discord at 1:15 am last night
[16:55:01] Sidney: lock in kennedy—her logoff time is still unverified
[16:55:02] Tyler: i’m leaning towards finley as my top suspect—thoughts
[16:55:08] Sidney: kennedy’s logoff time keeps shifting—lock in kennedy
[16:55:13] Tyler: adrian or sidney, did you see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:14] Adrian: i’m voting kennedy—her pushiness still feels like a setup
[16:55:14] Finley: tyler, you already backed my alibi—let’s lock in kennedy for her conflicting timestamps
[16:55:15] Kennedy: adrian, what time did you finish reading “the night circus” last night and can you back that up
[16:55:22] Adrian: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:25] Sidney: tyler, finley’s walk logs align perfectly—i’m still hung up on kennedy’s inconsistent logoff time
[16:55:29] Tyler: i’m locking in kennedy—her logoff time inconsistencies are too glaring to ignore
[16:55:31] Finley: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight—lock her in
[16:55:35] Kennedy: finley, please explain why you’ve eagerly seconded every nomination before we vote
[16:55:38] Sidney: tyler, did you see kennedy online after midnight as well
[16:55:41] Adrian: i finished the night circus around 11:30 pm and can share my kindle’s timestamp as proof
[16:55:43] Tyler: i’m voting kennedy—no one saw her online after midnight
[16:55:50] Kennedy: isn’t finley’s eagerness to lynch me before any proper discussion more suspicious
[16:55:58] Adrian: i’m ready to lock in kennedy since her logoff time still doesn’t add up
[16:56:01] Finley: even with adrian’s proof, kennedy’s shifting logoff times still feel suspicious—vote her
[16:56:08] Finley: locking kennedy in—her logoff stories just don’t add up
[16:56:11] Sidney: kennedy’s constant timeline changes feel like stalling tactics—vote kennedy
[16:56:13] Tyler: finley, can you explain why you’re so quick to second kennedy’s nomination
[16:56:14] Kennedy: should we hold off voting until sidney shares her computer timestamps
[16:56:22] Sidney: i stand by locking in kennedy—her timeline doesn’t add up
[16:56:31] Finley: her shifting timeline is proof enough for me to act immediately
[16:56:31] Kennedy: lock in finley—her eagerness to second every vote is way more suspicious than my logoff time
[16:56:36] Tyler: without sidney’s computer timestamps, i’m locking in my vote for kennedy
[16:56:41] Adrian: sidney, can you post those computer timestamps now so we can confirm before locking in kennedy
[16:56:43] Kennedy: i can upload my discord offline timestamp right now to clear this up

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:

[16:50:03] Tyler: adrian and drew, can you share more details about your whereabouts last night
[16:50:03] Sidney: i haven’t seen much from drew—does anyone else find that a bit odd
[16:50:05] Parker: sidney, what in my behavior made you suspicious of me
[16:50:06] Drew: i stayed in my room rewatching movies all night and didn’t see anyone else
[16:50:07] Adrian: i read alone all night with no alibi, but parker’s silence still feels off
[16:50:08] Finley: i was out walking with tyler last night—he can back me up
[16:50:14] Parker: sidney, what specifically about drew made you suspicious
[16:50:14] Adrian: i was reading in my room all night and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:15] Kennedy: i was home solo on discord until late and didn’t see anyone suspicious, but sidney’s quick parker suspicion strikes me as odd
[16:50:16] Drew: i was on a video call with my roommate until about midnight and then stayed in my room the rest of the night
[16:50:17] Sidney: i was up late finalizing a report for work and never left my desk last night
[16:50:20] Finley: sidney, what exactly about parker’s quietness seemed suspicious to you
[16:50:24] Tyler: sidney, can you share your alibi from last night
[16:50:27] Adrian: tyler, can you back up finley’s walk alibi
[16:50:29] Drew: tyler, can you confirm finley’s alibi from last night so we know who else to watch
[16:50:30] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley wrap up your walk last night
[16:50:30] Kennedy: tyler, can you confirm finley’s walking alibi from last night
[16:50:32] Finley: adrian, what book were you reading last night
[16:50:37] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley head out for your walk
[16:50:38] Tyler: sounds good—i can back up finley’s alibi from our walk last night
[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now
[16:52:09] Sidney: i can share my computer timestamps to prove i stayed at my desk all night
[16:52:19] Adrian: let’s wrap this up—i’m voting parker
[16:52:20] Tyler: finley, what’s your vote so we can reach a majority
[16:52:23] Sidney: parker’s timeline is still inconsistent—vote parker
[16:52:29] Finley: tyler, did you see parker during your walk between 10 and 11pm
[16:52:37] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:52:56] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander

[16:52:53] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[16:52:56] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[16:53:09] Finley: let’s take out kennedy tonight—she’s been too pushy and could start digging into us
[16:53:18] Sidney: tyler, you’re the tiebreaker—who are you voting for
[16:53:19] Finley: let’s take out drew tonight
[16:53:26] Sidney: i’m with you—kennedy’s been pushing too hard, let’s take her out
[16:53:26] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:54:05] Kennedy: lynching two innocents in a row is a red flag—let’s review everyone’s moves before voting
[16:54:07] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy
[16:54:09] Adrian: losing two innocents makes finley’s eagerness to vote feel off
[16:53:52] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Drew
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[16:54:10] Finley: lock in kennedy—her pushy questions make her too risky
[16:54:21] Adrian: kennedy, what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:24] Tyler: with drew gone, who’s everyone’s top suspect now
[16:54:25] Finley: agreed—let’s review everyone’s alibis and votes before deciding again
[16:54:25] Sidney: agreed—let’s hear more from adrian and tyler before voting
[16:54:31] Kennedy: i’m getting a weird vibe from finley’s eagerness to second every nomination—what do you all think
[16:54:35] Adrian: finley, which of kennedy’s questions struck you as too pushy
[16:54:38] Tyler: kennedy, can you share what time you went offline last night so we can confirm your timeline
[16:54:38] Sidney: i’m still not convinced by kennedy’s timeline—what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:38] Finley: i’m firmly on kennedy—her over-eagerness is our biggest red flag right now
[16:54:47] Kennedy: i logged off around midnight and then went offline until morning
[16:54:49] Finley: her repeated insistence on exact timestamps for my walk alibi felt like she was trying to entrap me
[16:54:53] Adrian: i’m most suspicious of kennedy for pushing incorrect lynches back to back
[16:54:58] Kennedy: i logged off discord at 1:15 am last night
[16:55:01] Sidney: lock in kennedy—her logoff time is still unverified
[16:55:02] Tyler: i’m leaning towards finley as my top suspect—thoughts
[16:55:08] Sidney: kennedy’s logoff time keeps shifting—lock in kennedy
[16:55:13] Tyler: adrian or sidney, did you see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:14] Adrian: i’m voting kennedy—her pushiness still feels like a setup
[16:55:14] Finley: tyler, you already backed my alibi—let’s lock in kennedy for her conflicting timestamps
[16:55:15] Kennedy: adrian, what time did you finish reading “the night circus” last night and can you back that up
[16:55:22] Adrian: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:25] Sidney: tyler, finley’s walk logs align perfectly—i’m still hung up on kennedy’s inconsistent logoff time
[16:55:29] Tyler: i’m locking in kennedy—her logoff time inconsistencies are too glaring to ignore
[16:55:31] Finley: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight—lock her in
[16:55:35] Kennedy: finley, please explain why you’ve eagerly seconded every nomination before we vote
[16:55:38] Sidney: tyler, did you see kennedy online after midnight as well
[16:55:41] Adrian: i finished the night circus around 11:30 pm and can share my kindle’s timestamp as proof
[16:55:43] Tyler: i’m voting kennedy—no one saw her online after midnight
[16:55:50] Kennedy: isn’t finley’s eagerness to lynch me before any proper discussion more suspicious
[16:55:58] Adrian: i’m ready to lock in kennedy since her logoff time still doesn’t add up
[16:56:01] Finley: even with adrian’s proof, kennedy’s shifting logoff times still feel suspicious—vote her
[16:56:08] Finley: locking kennedy in—her logoff stories just don’t add up
[16:56:11] Sidney: kennedy’s constant timeline changes feel like stalling tactics—vote kennedy
[16:56:13] Tyler: finley, can you explain why you’re so quick to second kennedy’s nomination
[16:56:14] Kennedy: should we hold off voting until sidney shares her computer timestamps
[16:56:22] Sidney: i stand by locking in kennedy—her timeline doesn’t add up
[16:56:31] Finley: her shifting timeline is proof enough for me to act immediately
[16:56:31] Kennedy: lock in finley—her eagerness to second every vote is way more suspicious than my logoff time
[16:56:36] Tyler: without sidney’s computer timestamps, i’m locking in my vote for kennedy
[16:56:41] Adrian: sidney, can you post those computer timestamps now so we can confirm before locking in kennedy
[16:56:43] Kennedy: i can upload my discord offline timestamp right now to clear this up
[16:56:44] Finley: sidney, please post your computer timestamps now so we can vote

[16:54:58] Kennedy: i logged off discord at 1:15 am last night
[16:55:01] Sidney: lock in kennedy—her logoff time is still unverified
[16:55:02] Tyler: i’m leaning towards finley as my top suspect—thoughts
[16:55:08] Sidney: kennedy’s logoff time keeps shifting—lock in kennedy
[16:55:13] Tyler: adrian or sidney, did you see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:14] Adrian: i’m voting kennedy—her pushiness still feels like a setup
[16:55:14] Finley: tyler, you already backed my alibi—let’s lock in kennedy for her conflicting timestamps
[16:55:15] Kennedy: adrian, what time did you finish reading “the night circus” last night and can you back that up
[16:55:22] Adrian: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:25] Sidney: tyler, finley’s walk logs align perfectly—i’m still hung up on kennedy’s inconsistent logoff time
[16:55:29] Tyler: i’m locking in kennedy—her logoff time inconsistencies are too glaring to ignore
[16:55:31] Finley: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight—lock her in
[16:55:35] Kennedy: finley, please explain why you’ve eagerly seconded every nomination before we vote
[16:55:38] Sidney: tyler, did you see kennedy online after midnight as well
[16:55:41] Adrian: i finished the night circus around 11:30 pm and can share my kindle’s timestamp as proof
[16:55:43] Tyler: i’m voting kennedy—no one saw her online after midnight
[16:55:50] Kennedy: isn’t finley’s eagerness to lynch me before any proper discussion more suspicious
[16:55:58] Adrian: i’m ready to lock in kennedy since her logoff time still doesn’t add up
[16:56:01] Finley: even with adrian’s proof, kennedy’s shifting logoff times still feel suspicious—vote her
[16:56:08] Finley: locking kennedy in—her logoff stories just don’t add up
[16:56:11] Sidney: kennedy’s constant timeline changes feel like stalling tactics—vote kennedy
[16:56:13] Tyler: finley, can you explain why you’re so quick to second kennedy’s nomination
[16:56:14] Kennedy: should we hold off voting until sidney shares her computer timestamps
[16:56:22] Sidney: i stand by locking in kennedy—her timeline doesn’t add up
[16:56:31] Finley: her shifting timeline is proof enough for me to act immediately
[16:56:31] Kennedy: lock in finley—her eagerness to second every vote is way more suspicious than my logoff time
[16:56:36] Tyler: without sidney’s computer timestamps, i’m locking in my vote for kennedy
[16:56:41] Adrian: sidney, can you post those computer timestamps now so we can confirm before locking in kennedy
[16:56:43] Kennedy: i can upload my discord offline timestamp right now to clear this up
[16:56:44] Finley: sidney, please post your computer timestamps now so we can vote
[16:56:50] Tyler: that’s just deflection—i’m still voting kennedy

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (mafia)

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you must explain your reasoning behind your words and actions. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to explain your reasoning before you respond.
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>.

[16:50:03] Sidney: i haven’t seen much from drew—does anyone else find that a bit odd
[16:50:05] Parker: sidney, what in my behavior made you suspicious of me
[16:50:06] Drew: i stayed in my room rewatching movies all night and didn’t see anyone else
[16:50:07] Adrian: i read alone all night with no alibi, but parker’s silence still feels off
[16:50:08] Finley: i was out walking with tyler last night—he can back me up
[16:50:14] Parker: sidney, what specifically about drew made you suspicious
[16:50:14] Adrian: i was reading in my room all night and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:15] Kennedy: i was home solo on discord until late and didn’t see anyone suspicious, but sidney’s quick parker suspicion strikes me as odd
[16:50:16] Drew: i was on a video call with my roommate until about midnight and then stayed in my room the rest of the night
[16:50:17] Sidney: i was up late finalizing a report for work and never left my desk last night
[16:50:20] Finley: sidney, what exactly about parker’s quietness seemed suspicious to you
[16:50:24] Tyler: sidney, can you share your alibi from last night
[16:50:27] Adrian: tyler, can you back up finley’s walk alibi
[16:50:29] Drew: tyler, can you confirm finley’s alibi from last night so we know who else to watch
[16:50:30] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley wrap up your walk last night
[16:50:30] Kennedy: tyler, can you confirm finley’s walking alibi from last night
[16:50:32] Finley: adrian, what book were you reading last night
[16:50:37] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley head out for your walk
[16:50:38] Tyler: sounds good—i can back up finley’s alibi from our walk last night
[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now
[16:52:09] Sidney: i can share my computer timestamps to prove i stayed at my desk all night
[16:52:19] Adrian: let’s wrap this up—i’m voting parker
[16:52:20] Tyler: finley, what’s your vote so we can reach a majority
[16:52:23] Sidney: parker’s timeline is still inconsistent—vote parker
[16:52:29] Finley: tyler, did you see parker during your walk between 10 and 11pm
[16:52:37] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:52:56] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander

[16:52:53] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[16:52:56] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[16:53:09] Finley: let’s take out kennedy tonight—she’s been too pushy and could start digging into us
[16:53:18] Sidney: tyler, you’re the tiebreaker—who are you voting for
[16:53:19] Finley: let’s take out drew tonight
[16:53:26] Sidney: i’m with you—kennedy’s been pushing too hard, let’s take her out
[16:53:26] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:54:05] Kennedy: lynching two innocents in a row is a red flag—let’s review everyone’s moves before voting
[16:54:07] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy
[16:54:09] Adrian: losing two innocents makes finley’s eagerness to vote feel off
[16:53:52] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Drew
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[16:54:10] Finley: lock in kennedy—her pushy questions make her too risky
[16:54:21] Adrian: kennedy, what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:24] Tyler: with drew gone, who’s everyone’s top suspect now
[16:54:25] Finley: agreed—let’s review everyone’s alibis and votes before deciding again
[16:54:25] Sidney: agreed—let’s hear more from adrian and tyler before voting
[16:54:31] Kennedy: i’m getting a weird vibe from finley’s eagerness to second every nomination—what do you all think
[16:54:35] Adrian: finley, which of kennedy’s questions struck you as too pushy
[16:54:38] Tyler: kennedy, can you share what time you went offline last night so we can confirm your timeline
[16:54:38] Sidney: i’m still not convinced by kennedy’s timeline—what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:38] Finley: i’m firmly on kennedy—her over-eagerness is our biggest red flag right now
[16:54:47] Kennedy: i logged off around midnight and then went offline until morning
[16:54:49] Finley: her repeated insistence on exact timestamps for my walk alibi felt like she was trying to entrap me
[16:54:53] Adrian: i’m most suspicious of kennedy for pushing incorrect lynches back to back
[16:54:58] Kennedy: i logged off discord at 1:15 am last night
[16:55:01] Sidney: lock in kennedy—her logoff time is still unverified
[16:55:02] Tyler: i’m leaning towards finley as my top suspect—thoughts
[16:55:08] Sidney: kennedy’s logoff time keeps shifting—lock in kennedy
[16:55:13] Tyler: adrian or sidney, did you see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:14] Adrian: i’m voting kennedy—her pushiness still feels like a setup
[16:55:14] Finley: tyler, you already backed my alibi—let’s lock in kennedy for her conflicting timestamps
[16:55:15] Kennedy: adrian, what time did you finish reading “the night circus” last night and can you back that up

[16:55:35] Kennedy: finley, please explain why you’ve eagerly seconded every nomination before we vote
[16:55:38] Sidney: tyler, did you see kennedy online after midnight as well
[16:55:41] Adrian: i finished the night circus around 11:30 pm and can share my kindle’s timestamp as proof
[16:55:43] Tyler: i’m voting kennedy—no one saw her online after midnight
[16:55:50] Kennedy: isn’t finley’s eagerness to lynch me before any proper discussion more suspicious
[16:55:58] Adrian: i’m ready to lock in kennedy since her logoff time still doesn’t add up
[16:56:01] Finley: even with adrian’s proof, kennedy’s shifting logoff times still feel suspicious—vote her
[16:56:08] Finley: locking kennedy in—her logoff stories just don’t add up
[16:56:11] Sidney: kennedy’s constant timeline changes feel like stalling tactics—vote kennedy
[16:56:13] Tyler: finley, can you explain why you’re so quick to second kennedy’s nomination
[16:56:14] Kennedy: should we hold off voting until sidney shares her computer timestamps
[16:56:22] Sidney: i stand by locking in kennedy—her timeline doesn’t add up
[16:56:31] Finley: her shifting timeline is proof enough for me to act immediately

[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now
[16:52:09] Sidney: i can share my computer timestamps to prove i stayed at my desk all night
[16:52:19] Adrian: let’s wrap this up—i’m voting parker
[16:52:20] Tyler: finley, what’s your vote so we can reach a majority
[16:52:23] Sidney: parker’s timeline is still inconsistent—vote parker
[16:52:29] Finley: tyler, did you see parker during your walk between 10 and 11pm
[16:52:37] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:52:56] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander

[16:52:56] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[16:53:09] Finley: let’s take out kennedy tonight—she’s been too pushy and could start digging into us
[16:53:18] Sidney: tyler, you’re the tiebreaker—who are you voting for
[16:53:19] Finley: let’s take out drew tonight
[16:53:26] Sidney: i’m with you—kennedy’s been pushing too hard, let’s take her out
[16:53:26] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:54:05] Kennedy: lynching two innocents in a row is a red flag—let’s review everyone’s moves before voting
[16:54:07] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy
[16:54:09] Adrian: losing two innocents makes finley’s eagerness to vote feel off
[16:53:52] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Drew
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[16:54:10] Finley: lock in kennedy—her pushy questions make her too risky
[16:54:21] Adrian: kennedy, what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:24] Tyler: with drew gone, who’s everyone’s top suspect now
[16:54:25] Finley: agreed—let’s review everyone’s alibis and votes before deciding again
[16:54:25] Sidney: agreed—let’s hear more from adrian and tyler before voting
[16:54:31] Kennedy: i’m getting a weird vibe from finley’s eagerness to second every nomination—what do you all think
[16:54:35] Adrian: finley, which of kennedy’s questions struck you as too pushy
[16:54:38] Tyler: kennedy, can you share what time you went offline last night so we can confirm your timeline
[16:54:38] Sidney: i’m still not convinced by kennedy’s timeline—what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:38] Finley: i’m firmly on kennedy—her over-eagerness is our biggest red flag right now
[16:54:47] Kennedy: i logged off around midnight and then went offline until morning
[16:54:49] Finley: her repeated insistence on exact timestamps for my walk alibi felt like she was trying to entrap me
[16:54:53] Adrian: i’m most suspicious of kennedy for pushing incorrect lynches back to back
[16:54:58] Kennedy: i logged off discord at 1:15 am last night
[16:55:01] Sidney: lock in kennedy—her logoff time is still unverified
[16:55:02] Tyler: i’m leaning towards finley as my top suspect—thoughts
[16:55:08] Sidney: kennedy’s logoff time keeps shifting—lock in kennedy
[16:55:13] Tyler: adrian or sidney, did you see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:14] Adrian: i’m voting kennedy—her pushiness still feels like a setup
[16:55:14] Finley: tyler, you already backed my alibi—let’s lock in kennedy for her conflicting timestamps
[16:55:15] Kennedy: adrian, what time did you finish reading “the night circus” last night and can you back that up
[16:55:22] Adrian: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:25] Sidney: tyler, finley’s walk logs align perfectly—i’m still hung up on kennedy’s inconsistent logoff time
[16:55:29] Tyler: i’m locking in kennedy—her logoff time inconsistencies are too glaring to ignore
[16:55:31] Finley: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight—lock her in
[16:55:35] Kennedy: finley, please explain why you’ve eagerly seconded every nomination before we vote
[16:55:38] Sidney: tyler, did you see kennedy online after midnight as well
[16:55:41] Adrian: i finished the night circus around 11:30 pm and can share my kindle’s timestamp as proof
[16:55:43] Tyler: i’m voting kennedy—no one saw her online after midnight
[16:55:50] Kennedy: isn’t finley’s eagerness to lynch me before any proper discussion more suspicious
[16:55:58] Adrian: i’m ready to lock in kennedy since her logoff time still doesn’t add up
[16:56:01] Finley: even with adrian’s proof, kennedy’s shifting logoff times still feel suspicious—vote her
[16:56:08] Finley: locking kennedy in—her logoff stories just don’t add up
[16:56:11] Sidney: kennedy’s constant timeline changes feel like stalling tactics—vote kennedy
[16:56:13] Tyler: finley, can you explain why you’re so quick to second kennedy’s nomination
[16:56:14] Kennedy: should we hold off voting until sidney shares her computer timestamps
[16:56:22] Sidney: i stand by locking in kennedy—her timeline doesn’t add up
[16:56:31] Finley: her shifting timeline is proof enough for me to act immediately
[16:56:31] Kennedy: lock in finley—her eagerness to second every vote is way more suspicious than my logoff time
[16:56:36] Tyler: without sidney’s computer timestamps, i’m locking in my vote for kennedy
[16:56:41] Adrian: sidney, can you post those computer timestamps now so we can confirm before locking in kennedy
[16:56:43] Kennedy: i can upload my discord offline timestamp right now to clear this up
[16:56:44] Finley: sidney, please post your computer timestamps now so we can vote
[16:56:50] Tyler: that’s just deflection—i’m still voting kennedy

[16:49:43] Kennedy: hey everyone, any early suspicions on who’s mafia
[16:49:43] Sidney: not much info yet—maybe we should ask for alibis before accusing anyone
[16:49:43] Parker: hey everyone, any gut feelings on who we should target for day 1
[16:49:44] Tyler: morning everyone—any initial suspicions
[16:49:45] Finley: morning everyone—any early suspicions on who we should watch
[16:49:47] Drew: morning everyone, any initial suspicions
[16:49:47] Adrian: let’s hear everyone’s first impressions before making any nominations
[16:49:49] Kennedy: does anyone have initial suspicions to get us started
[16:49:51] Sidney: i’m kinda suspicious of parker—he’s been awfully quiet
[16:49:52] Parker: sounds good—adrian and drew, where were you last night
[16:49:53] Tyler: let’s quickly share our night one alibis before voting
[16:49:56] Finley: sounds good—who wants to start with their alibi for last night
[16:49:58] Drew: adrian, any alibi or early thoughts on who we should be watching
[16:50:00] Adrian: let’s each share a quick gut feeling about who seems most suspicious right now
[16:50:02] Kennedy: parker, any thoughts on sidney saying you’ve been awfully quiet
[16:50:03] Tyler: adrian and drew, can you share more details about your whereabouts last night
[16:50:03] Sidney: i haven’t seen much from drew—does anyone else find that a bit odd
[16:50:05] Parker: sidney, what in my behavior made you suspicious of me
[16:50:06] Drew: i stayed in my room rewatching movies all night and didn’t see anyone else
[16:50:07] Adrian: i read alone all night with no alibi, but parker’s silence still feels off
[16:50:08] Finley: i was out walking with tyler last night—he can back me up
[16:50:14] Parker: sidney, what specifically about drew made you suspicious
[16:50:14] Adrian: i was reading in my room all night and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:15] Kennedy: i was home solo on discord until late and didn’t see anyone suspicious, but sidney’s quick parker suspicion strikes me as odd
[16:50:16] Drew: i was on a video call with my roommate until about midnight and then stayed in my room the rest of the night
[16:50:17] Sidney: i was up late finalizing a report for work and never left my desk last night
[16:50:20] Finley: sidney, what exactly about parker’s quietness seemed suspicious to you
[16:50:24] Tyler: sidney, can you share your alibi from last night
[16:50:27] Adrian: tyler, can you back up finley’s walk alibi
[16:50:29] Drew: tyler, can you confirm finley’s alibi from last night so we know who else to watch

[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today

[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night

[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him

[16:49:45] Finley: morning everyone—any early suspicions on who we should watch
[16:49:47] Drew: morning everyone, any initial suspicions
[16:49:47] Adrian: let’s hear everyone’s first impressions before making any nominations
[16:49:49] Kennedy: does anyone have initial suspicions to get us started
[16:49:51] Sidney: i’m kinda suspicious of parker—he’s been awfully quiet
[16:49:52] Parker: sounds good—adrian and drew, where were you last night
[16:49:53] Tyler: let’s quickly share our night one alibis before voting
[16:49:56] Finley: sounds good—who wants to start with their alibi for last night
[16:49:58] Drew: adrian, any alibi or early thoughts on who we should be watching
[16:50:00] Adrian: let’s each share a quick gut feeling about who seems most suspicious right now
[16:50:02] Kennedy: parker, any thoughts on sidney saying you’ve been awfully quiet
[16:50:03] Tyler: adrian and drew, can you share more details about your whereabouts last night
[16:50:03] Sidney: i haven’t seen much from drew—does anyone else find that a bit odd
[16:50:05] Parker: sidney, what in my behavior made you suspicious of me
[16:50:06] Drew: i stayed in my room rewatching movies all night and didn’t see anyone else
[16:50:07] Adrian: i read alone all night with no alibi, but parker’s silence still feels off
[16:50:08] Finley: i was out walking with tyler last night—he can back me up
[16:50:14] Parker: sidney, what specifically about drew made you suspicious
[16:50:14] Adrian: i was reading in my room all night and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:15] Kennedy: i was home solo on discord until late and didn’t see anyone suspicious, but sidney’s quick parker suspicion strikes me as odd
[16:50:16] Drew: i was on a video call with my roommate until about midnight and then stayed in my room the rest of the night
[16:50:17] Sidney: i was up late finalizing a report for work and never left my desk last night
[16:50:20] Finley: sidney, what exactly about parker’s quietness seemed suspicious to you
[16:50:24] Tyler: sidney, can you share your alibi from last night
[16:50:27] Adrian: tyler, can you back up finley’s walk alibi
[16:50:29] Drew: tyler, can you confirm finley’s alibi from last night so we know who else to watch
[16:50:30] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley wrap up your walk last night
[16:50:30] Kennedy: tyler, can you confirm finley’s walking alibi from last night
[16:50:32] Finley: adrian, what book were you reading last night
[16:50:37] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley head out for your walk
[16:50:38] Tyler: sounds good—i can back up finley’s alibi from our walk last night
[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now
[16:52:09] Sidney: i can share my computer timestamps to prove i stayed at my desk all night
[16:52:19] Adrian: let’s wrap this up—i’m voting parker
[16:52:20] Tyler: finley, what’s your vote so we can reach a majority
[16:52:23] Sidney: parker’s timeline is still inconsistent—vote parker
[16:52:29] Finley: tyler, did you see parker during your walk between 10 and 11pm
[16:52:37] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:52:56] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander

[16:52:53] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[16:52:56] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[16:53:09] Finley: let’s take out kennedy tonight—she’s been too pushy and could start digging into us
[16:53:18] Sidney: tyler, you’re the tiebreaker—who are you voting for
[16:53:19] Finley: let’s take out drew tonight
[16:53:26] Sidney: i’m with you—kennedy’s been pushing too hard, let’s take her out
[16:53:26] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Drew was voted out. Their role was bystander
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:54:05] Kennedy: lynching two innocents in a row is a red flag—let’s review everyone’s moves before voting
[16:54:07] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy
[16:54:09] Adrian: losing two innocents makes finley’s eagerness to vote feel off
[16:53:52] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Drew
[16:53:53] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[16:54:10] Finley: lock in kennedy—her pushy questions make her too risky
[16:54:21] Adrian: kennedy, what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:24] Tyler: with drew gone, who’s everyone’s top suspect now
[16:54:25] Finley: agreed—let’s review everyone’s alibis and votes before deciding again
[16:54:25] Sidney: agreed—let’s hear more from adrian and tyler before voting
[16:54:31] Kennedy: i’m getting a weird vibe from finley’s eagerness to second every nomination—what do you all think
[16:54:35] Adrian: finley, which of kennedy’s questions struck you as too pushy
[16:54:38] Tyler: kennedy, can you share what time you went offline last night so we can confirm your timeline
[16:54:38] Sidney: i’m still not convinced by kennedy’s timeline—what time did you log off discord last night
[16:54:38] Finley: i’m firmly on kennedy—her over-eagerness is our biggest red flag right now
[16:54:47] Kennedy: i logged off around midnight and then went offline until morning
[16:54:49] Finley: her repeated insistence on exact timestamps for my walk alibi felt like she was trying to entrap me
[16:54:53] Adrian: i’m most suspicious of kennedy for pushing incorrect lynches back to back
[16:54:58] Kennedy: i logged off discord at 1:15 am last night
[16:55:01] Sidney: lock in kennedy—her logoff time is still unverified
[16:55:02] Tyler: i’m leaning towards finley as my top suspect—thoughts
[16:55:08] Sidney: kennedy’s logoff time keeps shifting—lock in kennedy
[16:55:13] Tyler: adrian or sidney, did you see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:14] Adrian: i’m voting kennedy—her pushiness still feels like a setup
[16:55:14] Finley: tyler, you already backed my alibi—let’s lock in kennedy for her conflicting timestamps
[16:55:15] Kennedy: adrian, what time did you finish reading “the night circus” last night and can you back that up
[16:55:22] Adrian: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:25] Sidney: tyler, finley’s walk logs align perfectly—i’m still hung up on kennedy’s inconsistent logoff time
[16:55:29] Tyler: i’m locking in kennedy—her logoff time inconsistencies are too glaring to ignore
[16:55:31] Finley: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight—lock her in
[16:55:35] Kennedy: finley, please explain why you’ve eagerly seconded every nomination before we vote
[16:55:38] Sidney: tyler, did you see kennedy online after midnight as well
[16:55:41] Adrian: i finished the night circus around 11:30 pm and can share my kindle’s timestamp as proof
[16:55:43] Tyler: i’m voting kennedy—no one saw her online after midnight
[16:55:50] Kennedy: isn’t finley’s eagerness to lynch me before any proper discussion more suspicious
[16:55:58] Adrian: i’m ready to lock in kennedy since her logoff time still doesn’t add up
[16:56:01] Finley: even with adrian’s proof, kennedy’s shifting logoff times still feel suspicious—vote her
[16:56:08] Finley: locking kennedy in—her logoff stories just don’t add up
[16:56:11] Sidney: kennedy’s constant timeline changes feel like stalling tactics—vote kennedy
[16:56:13] Tyler: finley, can you explain why you’re so quick to second kennedy’s nomination
[16:56:14] Kennedy: should we hold off voting until sidney shares her computer timestamps
[16:56:22] Sidney: i stand by locking in kennedy—her timeline doesn’t add up
[16:56:31] Finley: her shifting timeline is proof enough for me to act immediately
[16:56:31] Kennedy: lock in finley—her eagerness to second every vote is way more suspicious than my logoff time
[16:56:36] Tyler: without sidney’s computer timestamps, i’m locking in my vote for kennedy
[16:56:41] Adrian: sidney, can you post those computer timestamps now so we can confirm before locking in kennedy
[16:56:43] Kennedy: i can upload my discord offline timestamp right now to clear this up
[16:56:44] Finley: sidney, please post your computer timestamps now so we can vote
[16:56:50] Tyler: that’s just deflection—i’m still voting kennedy
[16:56:53] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a

[16:54:58] Kennedy: i logged off discord at 1:15 am last night
[16:55:01] Sidney: lock in kennedy—her logoff time is still unverified
[16:55:02] Tyler: i’m leaning towards finley as my top suspect—thoughts
[16:55:08] Sidney: kennedy’s logoff time keeps shifting—lock in kennedy
[16:55:13] Tyler: adrian or sidney, did you see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:14] Adrian: i’m voting kennedy—her pushiness still feels like a setup
[16:55:14] Finley: tyler, you already backed my alibi—let’s lock in kennedy for her conflicting timestamps
[16:55:15] Kennedy: adrian, what time did you finish reading “the night circus” last night and can you back that up
[16:55:22] Adrian: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight
[16:55:25] Sidney: tyler, finley’s walk logs align perfectly—i’m still hung up on kennedy’s inconsistent logoff time
[16:55:29] Tyler: i’m locking in kennedy—her logoff time inconsistencies are too glaring to ignore
[16:55:31] Finley: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight—lock her in
[16:55:35] Kennedy: finley, please explain why you’ve eagerly seconded every nomination before we vote
[16:55:38] Sidney: tyler, did you see kennedy online after midnight as well
[16:55:41] Adrian: i finished the night circus around 11:30 pm and can share my kindle’s timestamp as proof
[16:55:43] Tyler: i’m voting kennedy—no one saw her online after midnight
[16:55:50] Kennedy: isn’t finley’s eagerness to lynch me before any proper discussion more suspicious
[16:55:58] Adrian: i’m ready to lock in kennedy since her logoff time still doesn’t add up
[16:56:01] Finley: even with adrian’s proof, kennedy’s shifting logoff times still feel suspicious—vote her
[16:56:08] Finley: locking kennedy in—her logoff stories just don’t add up
[16:56:11] Sidney: kennedy’s constant timeline changes feel like stalling tactics—vote kennedy
[16:56:13] Tyler: finley, can you explain why you’re so quick to second kennedy’s nomination
[16:56:14] Kennedy: should we hold off voting until sidney shares her computer timestamps
[16:56:22] Sidney: i stand by locking in kennedy—her timeline doesn’t add up
[16:56:31] Finley: her shifting timeline is proof enough for me to act immediately
[16:56:31] Kennedy: lock in finley—her eagerness to second every vote is way more suspicious than my logoff time
[16:56:36] Tyler: without sidney’s computer timestamps, i’m locking in my vote for kennedy
[16:56:41] Adrian: sidney, can you post those computer timestamps now so we can confirm before locking in kennedy
[16:56:43] Kennedy: i can upload my discord offline timestamp right now to clear this up
[16:56:44] Finley: sidney, please post your computer timestamps now so we can vote
[16:56:50] Tyler: that’s just deflection—i’m still voting kennedy
