[16:49:43] Sidney: not much info yet—maybe we should ask for alibis before accusing anyone
[16:49:51] Sidney: i’m kinda suspicious of parker—he’s been awfully quiet
[16:50:03] Sidney: i haven’t seen much from drew—does anyone else find that a bit odd
[16:50:17] Sidney: i was up late finalizing a report for work and never left my desk last night
[16:50:30] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley wrap up your walk last night
[16:50:37] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley head out for your walk
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:52:09] Sidney: i can share my computer timestamps to prove i stayed at my desk all night
[16:52:23] Sidney: parker’s timeline is still inconsistent—vote parker
[16:53:18] Sidney: tyler, you’re the tiebreaker—who are you voting for
[16:53:26] Sidney: i’m with you—kennedy’s been pushing too hard, let’s take her out
[16:54:07] Sidney: i’m voting kennedy
[16:54:25] Sidney: agreed—let’s hear more from adrian and tyler before voting
[16:54:38] Sidney: i’m still not convinced by kennedy’s timeline—what time did you log off discord last night
[16:55:01] Sidney: lock in kennedy—her logoff time is still unverified
[16:55:08] Sidney: kennedy’s logoff time keeps shifting—lock in kennedy
[16:55:25] Sidney: tyler, finley’s walk logs align perfectly—i’m still hung up on kennedy’s inconsistent logoff time
[16:55:38] Sidney: tyler, did you see kennedy online after midnight as well
[16:56:11] Sidney: kennedy’s constant timeline changes feel like stalling tactics—vote kennedy
[16:56:22] Sidney: i stand by locking in kennedy—her timeline doesn’t add up
