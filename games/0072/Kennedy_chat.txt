[16:49:43] Kennedy: hey everyone, any early suspicions on who’s mafia
[16:49:49] Kennedy: does anyone have initial suspicions to get us started
[16:50:02] Kennedy: parker, any thoughts on sidney saying you’ve been awfully quiet
[16:50:15] Kennedy: i was home solo on discord until late and didn’t see anyone suspicious, but sidney’s quick parker suspicion strikes me as odd
[16:50:30] Kennedy: tyler, can you confirm finley’s walking alibi from last night
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:54:05] Kennedy: lynching two innocents in a row is a red flag—let’s review everyone’s moves before voting
[16:54:31] Kennedy: i’m getting a weird vibe from finley’s eagerness to second every nomination—what do you all think
[16:54:47] Kennedy: i logged off around midnight and then went offline until morning
[16:54:58] Kennedy: i logged off discord at 1:15 am last night
[16:55:15] Kennedy: adrian, what time did you finish reading “the night circus” last night and can you back that up
[16:55:35] Kennedy: finley, please explain why you’ve eagerly seconded every nomination before we vote
[16:55:50] Kennedy: isn’t finley’s eagerness to lynch me before any proper discussion more suspicious
[16:56:14] Kennedy: should we hold off voting until sidney shares her computer timestamps
[16:56:31] Kennedy: lock in finley—her eagerness to second every vote is way more suspicious than my logoff time
[16:56:43] Kennedy: i can upload my discord offline timestamp right now to clear this up
[16:57:34] Kennedy: tyler, finley—please lock in your votes now
