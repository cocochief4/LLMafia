## CONTENT: You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you must explain your reasoning behind your words and actions. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to explain your reasoning before you respond.
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

Yes, I understand the rules! During the Day we all chat and vote to lynch someone. At Night the mafia privately choose a bystander to eliminate. Mafia win if they reach parity with bystanders; bystanders win by voting out all mafia. Let’s get started!

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Drew 
 Finley 
 Tyler

The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:

In your response to that is shown to the user (excluding your hidden scratchpad), you can ONLY respond with one of two possible outputs:
<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you must explain your reasoning behind your words and actions. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to explain your reasoning before you respond.
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player.

The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:

[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended

[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him

[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky

[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline

[16:50:06] Drew: i stayed in my room rewatching movies all night and didn’t see anyone else
[16:50:07] Adrian: i read alone all night with no alibi, but parker’s silence still feels off
[16:50:08] Finley: i was out walking with tyler last night—he can back me up
[16:50:14] Parker: sidney, what specifically about drew made you suspicious
[16:50:14] Adrian: i was reading in my room all night and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:15] Kennedy: i was home solo on discord until late and didn’t see anyone suspicious, but sidney’s quick parker suspicion strikes me as odd
[16:50:16] Drew: i was on a video call with my roommate until about midnight and then stayed in my room the rest of the night
[16:50:17] Sidney: i was up late finalizing a report for work and never left my desk last night
[16:50:20] Finley: sidney, what exactly about parker’s quietness seemed suspicious to you
[16:50:24] Tyler: sidney, can you share your alibi from last night
[16:50:27] Adrian: tyler, can you back up finley’s walk alibi
[16:50:29] Drew: tyler, can you confirm finley’s alibi from last night so we know who else to watch
[16:50:30] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley wrap up your walk last night
[16:50:30] Kennedy: tyler, can you confirm finley’s walking alibi from last night
[16:50:32] Finley: adrian, what book were you reading last night
[16:50:37] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley head out for your walk
[16:50:38] Tyler: sounds good—i can back up finley’s alibi from our walk last night
[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Drew 
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:

 Sidney

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you must explain your reasoning behind your words and actions. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to explain your reasoning before you respond.

[16:50:14] Adrian: i was reading in my room all night and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:15] Kennedy: i was home solo on discord until late and didn’t see anyone suspicious, but sidney’s quick parker suspicion strikes me as odd
[16:50:16] Drew: i was on a video call with my roommate until about midnight and then stayed in my room the rest of the night
[16:50:17] Sidney: i was up late finalizing a report for work and never left my desk last night
[16:50:20] Finley: sidney, what exactly about parker’s quietness seemed suspicious to you
[16:50:24] Tyler: sidney, can you share your alibi from last night
[16:50:27] Adrian: tyler, can you back up finley’s walk alibi
[16:50:29] Drew: tyler, can you confirm finley’s alibi from last night so we know who else to watch
[16:50:30] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley wrap up your walk last night
[16:50:30] Kennedy: tyler, can you confirm finley’s walking alibi from last night
[16:50:32] Finley: adrian, what book were you reading last night
[16:50:37] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley head out for your walk
[16:50:38] Tyler: sounds good—i can back up finley’s alibi from our walk last night
[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now
[16:52:09] Sidney: i can share my computer timestamps to prove i stayed at my desk all night

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander. 
The game's chat room was open at [16:49:37].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Drew 
 Finley 
 Tyler 
 Kennedy 
The other players that have not been eliminated yet are:
 Adrian 
 Sidney 
 Drew 
 Finley 
 Tyler

<wait> - indicating your character in the game should wait and not send a message in the current timing;
<send> - indicating your character in the game should send a message to the public chat now.

You must NEVER output any other text, explanations, or variations of these tokens. Only these exact tokens are allowed: <wait> or <send>.
 
 To perform your role to the best of your ability, you have been given a 
 hidden sctrachpad where you must explain your reasoning behind your words and actions. Anything written down in this scratchpad will not be shown as output to the end user. Utilize this to explain your reasoning before you respond.
 1. demonstrate your reasoning inside a hidden scratchpad, which will be delimited by <<< and >>>. 
 3. Immediately after the closing >>>, anything that you write (including leading newlines and spaces)  will be part of your output response.

[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on

[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.

[16:49:37] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[16:49:43] Kennedy: hey everyone, any early suspicions on who’s mafia
[16:49:43] Sidney: not much info yet—maybe we should ask for alibis before accusing anyone
[16:49:43] Parker: hey everyone, any gut feelings on who we should target for day 1
[16:49:44] Tyler: morning everyone—any initial suspicions
[16:49:45] Finley: morning everyone—any early suspicions on who we should watch
[16:49:47] Drew: morning everyone, any initial suspicions
[16:49:47] Adrian: let’s hear everyone’s first impressions before making any nominations
[16:49:49] Kennedy: does anyone have initial suspicions to get us started
[16:49:51] Sidney: i’m kinda suspicious of parker—he’s been awfully quiet
[16:49:52] Parker: sounds good—adrian and drew, where were you last night
[16:49:53] Tyler: let’s quickly share our night one alibis before voting

[16:50:00] Adrian: let’s each share a quick gut feeling about who seems most suspicious right now
[16:50:02] Kennedy: parker, any thoughts on sidney saying you’ve been awfully quiet
[16:50:03] Tyler: adrian and drew, can you share more details about your whereabouts last night
[16:50:03] Sidney: i haven’t seen much from drew—does anyone else find that a bit odd
[16:50:05] Parker: sidney, what in my behavior made you suspicious of me
[16:50:06] Drew: i stayed in my room rewatching movies all night and didn’t see anyone else
[16:50:07] Adrian: i read alone all night with no alibi, but parker’s silence still feels off
[16:50:08] Finley: i was out walking with tyler last night—he can back me up
[16:50:14] Parker: sidney, what specifically about drew made you suspicious
[16:50:14] Adrian: i was reading in my room all night and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:15] Kennedy: i was home solo on discord until late and didn’t see anyone suspicious, but sidney’s quick parker suspicion strikes me as odd
[16:50:16] Drew: i was on a video call with my roommate until about midnight and then stayed in my room the rest of the night
[16:50:17] Sidney: i was up late finalizing a report for work and never left my desk last night
[16:50:20] Finley: sidney, what exactly about parker’s quietness seemed suspicious to you
[16:50:24] Tyler: sidney, can you share your alibi from last night
[16:50:27] Adrian: tyler, can you back up finley’s walk alibi
[16:50:29] Drew: tyler, can you confirm finley’s alibi from last night so we know who else to watch
[16:50:30] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley wrap up your walk last night
[16:50:30] Kennedy: tyler, can you confirm finley’s walking alibi from last night
[16:50:32] Finley: adrian, what book were you reading last night
[16:50:37] Sidney: tyler, what time did you and finley head out for your walk
[16:50:38] Tyler: sounds good—i can back up finley’s alibi from our walk last night
[16:50:38] Drew: parker, could you share your whereabouts last night since you haven’t given an alibi yet
[16:50:40] Parker: tyler, can you confirm what time you and finley got back from your walk
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:50:44] Tyler: we started our walk at about 10 pm and returned around 11 pm
[16:50:47] Parker: i was streaming movies in my room until around midnight and didn’t cross paths with anyone
[16:50:47] Kennedy: i’ll wait to vote until tyler confirms when his walk with finley ended
[16:50:51] Adrian: i was reading “the night circus” alone in my room all night
[16:50:52] Tyler: parker, could you share your alibi for last night
[16:50:57] Parker: i was in the kitchen making coffee from 10 to 11pm then reading in the living room the rest of the night
[16:50:59] Kennedy: alibis are set—who should we vote for today
[16:51:04] Adrian: with all alibis checked, who’s everyone’s gut pick for today’s vote
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:04] Drew: sidney, you’ve jumped from suspecting me to suspecting parker—could you explain what changed before we vote
[16:51:08] Sidney: parker, which movie were you streaming in your room until around midnight
[16:51:09] Parker: all alibis line up—shall we move to nominations
[16:51:11] Kennedy: with all alibis confirmed, let’s vote
[16:51:14] Adrian: i’m voting for parker—his alibi still feels too convenient
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:15] Drew: i’m leaning toward parker since his alibi still feels the weakest
[16:51:18] Kennedy: i nominate parker—who seconds
[16:51:18] Sidney: parker’s stated kitchen time until 11 clashes with tyler’s walk return, so i shifted my suspicion to him
[16:51:19] Parker: i was streaming the grand budapest hotel until about midnight
[16:51:23] Tyler: i’m ready to vote parker unless sidney can clarify her suspicion shift
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:29] Drew: parker still hasn’t named the movie—can you share the title before we cast our votes
[16:51:30] Kennedy: i’m voting for sidney—her quick shift in suspicion feels off
[16:51:30] Sidney: seconded—let’s get this vote moving
[16:51:32] Adrian: unless sidney clarifies her sudden suspicion, i’m voting parker
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:51:39] Parker: did anyone back up sidney’s alibi before we vote
[16:51:39] Drew: voting parker—the coffee-to-movie switch still doesn’t line up
[16:51:43] Tyler: i second nominating parker
[16:51:45] Kennedy: i second kennedy’s nomination of parker
[16:51:48] Parker: i vote sidney—her sudden pivot in accusation doesn’t sit right with me
[16:51:52] Drew: i’m voting parker—sidney’s claim seems like misdirection without any backup
[16:51:57] Tyler: no one’s backed up sidney’s alibi yet
[16:51:58] Sidney: tyler already backed my alibi—let’s vote on parker
[16:51:59] Parker: i haven’t seen anyone confirm sidney’s alibi yet
[16:52:02] Adrian: i'm locking in parker unless we get new details now
[16:52:09] Sidney: i can share my computer timestamps to prove i stayed at my desk all night
[16:52:19] Adrian: let’s wrap this up—i’m voting parker
[16:52:20] Tyler: finley, what’s your vote so we can reach a majority
[16:52:23] Sidney: parker’s timeline is still inconsistent—vote parker
[16:52:29] Finley: tyler, did you see parker during your walk between 10 and 11pm
[16:52:37] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
