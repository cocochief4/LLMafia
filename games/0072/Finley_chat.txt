[16:49:45] Finley: morning everyone—any early suspicions on who we should watch
[16:49:56] Finley: sounds good—who wants to start with their alibi for last night
[16:50:08] Finley: i was out walking with tyler last night—he can back me up
[16:50:20] Finley: sidney, what exactly about parker’s quietness seemed suspicious to you
[16:50:32] Finley: adrian, what book were you reading last night
[16:50:44] Finley: parker, mind sharing your whereabouts last night so we can wrap up our alibis and move on
[16:51:04] Finley: parker, can you tell us what time you got back to your room last night
[16:51:14] Finley: i’m suspicious of sidney—pointing at parker so fast feels like misdirection
[16:51:24] Finley: voting parker—his coffee alibi seems shaky
[16:51:38] Finley: i second parker—his kitchen alibi overlaps with our walk timeline
[16:52:29] Finley: tyler, did you see parker during your walk between 10 and 11pm
[16:53:09] Finley: let’s take out kennedy tonight—she’s been too pushy and could start digging into us
[16:53:19] Finley: let’s take out drew tonight
[16:54:10] Finley: lock in kennedy—her pushy questions make her too risky
[16:54:25] Finley: agreed—let’s review everyone’s alibis and votes before deciding again
[16:54:38] Finley: i’m firmly on kennedy—her over-eagerness is our biggest red flag right now
[16:54:49] Finley: her repeated insistence on exact timestamps for my walk alibi felt like she was trying to entrap me
[16:55:14] Finley: tyler, you already backed my alibi—let’s lock in kennedy for her conflicting timestamps
[16:55:31] Finley: i didn’t see kennedy online after midnight—lock her in
[16:56:01] Finley: even with adrian’s proof, kennedy’s shifting logoff times still feel suspicious—vote her
[16:56:08] Finley: locking kennedy in—her logoff stories just don’t add up
[16:56:31] Finley: her shifting timeline is proof enough for me to act immediately
[16:56:44] Finley: sidney, please post your computer timestamps now so we can vote
