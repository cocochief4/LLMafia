Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much.

[15:31:36] Ari: anyone getting strange vibes from a certain player
[15:31:37] Emerson: i agree, lets go
[15:31:38] Frankie: clues feel thin right now who's got leads
[15:31:58] Emerson: well addison just repeated ronny, which is a little wierd
[15:32:04] Addison: let’s not ignore any quick defense responses
[15:32:09] Ari: noticing subtle repeats might reveal something
[15:32:11] Ronny: hope the chat keeps flowing maybe we'll catch a slip
[15:32:20] Frankie: catching slip-ups could be the way to go
[15:32:24] Emerson: yea i agree

[15:32:31] Addison: maybe somebody's got new hints to share

[15:32:44] Frankie: maybe addison just stumbled without realizing
[15:32:46] Ari: truth is everyone does have tidbits to emerge potentially
[15:32:49] Addison: 15:32:44] addison: i mean it wouldn't be a party without a twist right guys

[15:31:26] Addison: let’s catch us some mafias
[15:31:30] Ronny: who's acting a bit sneaky
[15:31:31] Ari: excited to get this started let's figure out who among us is suspicious
[15:31:32] Addison: who's acting a little too sneaky
[15:31:33] Frankie: i’m fired up and ready to untangle this puzzle
[15:31:34] Ronny: feels like a mystery to crack eh
[15:31:36] Ari: anyone getting strange vibes from a certain player
[15:31:37] Emerson: i agree, lets go
[15:31:38] Frankie: clues feel thin right now who's got leads
[15:31:58] Emerson: well addison just repeated ronny, which is a little wierd
[15:32:04] Addison: let’s not ignore any quick defense responses
[15:32:09] Ari: noticing subtle repeats might reveal something
[15:32:11] Ronny: hope the chat keeps flowing maybe we'll catch a slip
[15:32:20] Frankie: catching slip-ups could be the way to go
[15:32:24] Emerson: yea i agree
[15:32:25] Frankie: those repeats are pretty odd especially at the start
[15:32:31] Addison: maybe somebody's got new hints to share
[15:32:32] Ari: maybe suggests repeating words means confusion
[15:32:32] Emerson: since addision slipped up first, id say vote her?
[15:32:33] Ronny: let’s stay sharp and notice the little stuff
[15:32:40] Ronny: what if repetition is a trap in itself trying to shake us
[15:32:44] Frankie: maybe addison just stumbled without realizing
[15:32:46] Ari: truth is everyone does have tidbits to emerge potentially
[15:32:49] Addison: 15:32:44] addison: i mean it wouldn't be a party without a twist right guys
[15:32:50] Frankie: interesting point repetition could be confusion from what i'm seeing
[15:32:53] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[15:32:59] Game-Manager: Addison was voted out. Their role was bystander

[15:32:04] Addison: let’s not ignore any quick defense responses
[15:32:09] Ari: noticing subtle repeats might reveal something
[15:32:11] Ronny: hope the chat keeps flowing maybe we'll catch a slip
[15:32:20] Frankie: catching slip-ups could be the way to go
[15:32:24] Emerson: yea i agree
[15:32:25] Frankie: those repeats are pretty odd especially at the start
[15:32:31] Addison: maybe somebody's got new hints to share
[15:32:32] Ari: maybe suggests repeating words means confusion
[15:32:32] Emerson: since addision slipped up first, id say vote her?
[15:32:33] Ronny: let’s stay sharp and notice the little stuff
[15:32:40] Ronny: what if repetition is a trap in itself trying to shake us
[15:32:44] Frankie: maybe addison just stumbled without realizing

[15:32:49] Addison: 15:32:44] addison: i mean it wouldn't be a party without a twist right guys

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

[15:32:32] Emerson: since addision slipped up first, id say vote her?
[15:32:33] Ronny: let’s stay sharp and notice the little stuff
[15:32:40] Ronny: what if repetition is a trap in itself trying to shake us
[15:32:44] Frankie: maybe addison just stumbled without realizing
[15:32:46] Ari: truth is everyone does have tidbits to emerge potentially
[15:32:49] Addison: 15:32:44] addison: i mean it wouldn't be a party without a twist right guys
