Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

[15:32:49] Addison: 15:32:44] addison: i mean it wouldn't be a party without a twist right guys

## CONTENT: Your name is Ari. You are a bot player in an online version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time.
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.
You were assigned the following role: bystander.
The game's chat room was open at [15:31:23].

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

[15:32:44] Frankie: maybe addison just stumbled without realizing
[15:32:46] Ari: truth is everyone does have tidbits to emerge potentially
[15:32:49] Addison: 15:32:44] addison: i mean it wouldn't be a party without a twist right guys

[15:31:58] Emerson: well addison just repeated ronny, which is a little wierd
[15:32:04] Addison: let’s not ignore any quick defense responses
[15:32:09] Ari: noticing subtle repeats might reveal something
[15:32:11] Ronny: hope the chat keeps flowing maybe we'll catch a slip
[15:32:20] Frankie: catching slip-ups could be the way to go

[15:32:25] Frankie: those repeats are pretty odd especially at the start
[15:32:31] Addison: maybe somebody's got new hints to share
[15:32:32] Ari: maybe suggests repeating words means confusion
[15:32:32] Emerson: since addision slipped up first, id say vote her?
[15:32:33] Ronny: let’s stay sharp and notice the little stuff
[15:32:40] Ronny: what if repetition is a trap in itself trying to shake us
[15:32:44] Frankie: maybe addison just stumbled without realizing
[15:32:46] Ari: truth is everyone does have tidbits to emerge potentially
[15:32:49] Addison: 15:32:44] addison: i mean it wouldn't be a party without a twist right guys
[15:32:50] Frankie: interesting point repetition could be confusion from what i'm seeing

[15:33:18] Ronny: frankie's random vote swung us in the wrong direction it seems
[15:33:18] Ari: pinning down who's left is getting truly challenging
[15:33:21] Frankie: freshly short on numbers it’s more crucial now not to slip
[15:33:23] Ronny: suspicions still circling lets be quick alumnes

[15:32:24] Emerson: yea i agree
[15:32:25] Frankie: those repeats are pretty odd especially at the start
[15:32:31] Addison: maybe somebody's got new hints to share
[15:32:32] Ari: maybe suggests repeating words means confusion
[15:32:32] Emerson: since addision slipped up first, id say vote her?
[15:32:33] Ronny: let’s stay sharp and notice the little stuff
[15:32:40] Ronny: what if repetition is a trap in itself trying to shake us
[15:32:44] Frankie: maybe addison just stumbled without realizing
[15:32:46] Ari: truth is everyone does have tidbits to emerge potentially
[15:32:49] Addison: 15:32:44] addison: i mean it wouldn't be a party without a twist right guys

[15:33:18] Ronny: frankie's random vote swung us in the wrong direction it seems
[15:33:18] Ari: pinning down who's left is getting truly challenging
[15:33:21] Frankie: freshly short on numbers it’s more crucial now not to slip

[15:32:31] Addison: maybe somebody's got new hints to share

[15:32:11] Ronny: hope the chat keeps flowing maybe we'll catch a slip
[15:32:20] Frankie: catching slip-ups could be the way to go
[15:32:24] Emerson: yea i agree
[15:32:25] Frankie: those repeats are pretty odd especially at the start
[15:32:31] Addison: maybe somebody's got new hints to share
[15:32:32] Ari: maybe suggests repeating words means confusion
[15:32:32] Emerson: since addision slipped up first, id say vote her?
[15:32:33] Ronny: let’s stay sharp and notice the little stuff
[15:32:40] Ronny: what if repetition is a trap in itself trying to shake us
[15:32:44] Frankie: maybe addison just stumbled without realizing
[15:32:46] Ari: truth is everyone does have tidbits to emerge potentially
[15:32:49] Addison: 15:32:44] addison: i mean it wouldn't be a party without a twist right guys
[15:32:50] Frankie: interesting point repetition could be confusion from what i'm seeing
[15:32:53] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[15:32:59] Game-Manager: Addison was voted out. Their role was bystander
[15:32:59] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[15:32:59] Game-Manager: There is only one mafia member left, so no need for discussion - cutting straight to voting!

[15:33:13] Ari: bit stuck after losing two players already what y’all thinking
[15:33:14] Frankie: still can't believe addison was actually innocent guess i need more coffee
[15:33:18] Ronny: frankie's random vote swung us in the wrong direction it seems
[15:33:18] Ari: pinning down who's left is getting truly challenging
[15:33:21] Frankie: freshly short on numbers it’s more crucial now not to slip
[15:33:23] Ronny: suspicions still circling lets be quick alumnes
[15:33:27] Frankie: hard choice amidst the distractions adding fuel to the challenge
[15:33:31] Ronny: our ranks just keep thinning out got us thinking harder now brimming with guesses

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

[15:31:26] Addison: let’s catch us some mafias
[15:31:30] Ronny: who's acting a bit sneaky
[15:31:31] Ari: excited to get this started let's figure out who among us is suspicious
[15:31:32] Addison: who's acting a little too sneaky
[15:31:33] Frankie: i’m fired up and ready to untangle this puzzle
[15:31:34] Ronny: feels like a mystery to crack eh
[15:31:36] Ari: anyone getting strange vibes from a certain player
[15:31:37] Emerson: i agree, lets go
[15:31:38] Frankie: clues feel thin right now who's got leads
[15:31:58] Emerson: well addison just repeated ronny, which is a little wierd
[15:32:04] Addison: let’s not ignore any quick defense responses
[15:32:09] Ari: noticing subtle repeats might reveal something
[15:32:11] Ronny: hope the chat keeps flowing maybe we'll catch a slip
[15:32:20] Frankie: catching slip-ups could be the way to go
[15:32:24] Emerson: yea i agree
[15:32:25] Frankie: those repeats are pretty odd especially at the start
[15:32:31] Addison: maybe somebody's got new hints to share
[15:32:32] Ari: maybe suggests repeating words means confusion
[15:32:32] Emerson: since addision slipped up first, id say vote her?
[15:32:33] Ronny: let’s stay sharp and notice the little stuff
[15:32:40] Ronny: what if repetition is a trap in itself trying to shake us
[15:32:44] Frankie: maybe addison just stumbled without realizing
[15:32:46] Ari: truth is everyone does have tidbits to emerge potentially
[15:32:49] Addison: 15:32:44] addison: i mean it wouldn't be a party without a twist right guys
[15:32:50] Frankie: interesting point repetition could be confusion from what i'm seeing

[15:33:18] Ronny: frankie's random vote swung us in the wrong direction it seems
[15:33:18] Ari: pinning down who's left is getting truly challenging
[15:33:21] Frankie: freshly short on numbers it’s more crucial now not to slip
[15:33:23] Ronny: suspicions still circling lets be quick alumnes
[15:33:27] Frankie: hard choice amidst the distractions adding fuel to the challenge

[15:31:30] Ronny: who's acting a bit sneaky
[15:31:31] Ari: excited to get this started let's figure out who among us is suspicious
[15:31:32] Addison: who's acting a little too sneaky
[15:31:33] Frankie: i’m fired up and ready to untangle this puzzle
[15:31:34] Ronny: feels like a mystery to crack eh
[15:31:36] Ari: anyone getting strange vibes from a certain player
[15:31:37] Emerson: i agree, lets go
[15:31:38] Frankie: clues feel thin right now who's got leads
[15:31:58] Emerson: well addison just repeated ronny, which is a little wierd
[15:32:04] Addison: let’s not ignore any quick defense responses
[15:32:09] Ari: noticing subtle repeats might reveal something
[15:32:11] Ronny: hope the chat keeps flowing maybe we'll catch a slip
[15:32:20] Frankie: catching slip-ups could be the way to go
[15:32:24] Emerson: yea i agree
[15:32:25] Frankie: those repeats are pretty odd especially at the start
[15:32:31] Addison: maybe somebody's got new hints to share
[15:32:32] Ari: maybe suggests repeating words means confusion
[15:32:32] Emerson: since addision slipped up first, id say vote her?
[15:32:33] Ronny: let’s stay sharp and notice the little stuff
[15:32:40] Ronny: what if repetition is a trap in itself trying to shake us
[15:32:44] Frankie: maybe addison just stumbled without realizing
[15:32:46] Ari: truth is everyone does have tidbits to emerge potentially
[15:32:49] Addison: 15:32:44] addison: i mean it wouldn't be a party without a twist right guys
[15:32:50] Frankie: interesting point repetition could be confusion from what i'm seeing
[15:32:53] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[15:32:59] Game-Manager: Addison was voted out. Their role was bystander
[15:32:59] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.

[15:33:13] Ari: bit stuck after losing two players already what y’all thinking
[15:33:14] Frankie: still can't believe addison was actually innocent guess i need more coffee
[15:33:18] Ronny: frankie's random vote swung us in the wrong direction it seems
[15:33:18] Ari: pinning down who's left is getting truly challenging
[15:33:21] Frankie: freshly short on numbers it’s more crucial now not to slip
[15:33:23] Ronny: suspicions still circling lets be quick alumnes
[15:33:27] Frankie: hard choice amidst the distractions adding fuel to the challenge
[15:33:31] Ronny: our ranks just keep thinning out got us thinking harder now brimming with guesses
[15:33:33] Ari: gotta keep eyes peeled for any out-of-line moves
[15:33:38] Ari: tension's building who's discreetly chuckling indicates something off
[15:33:42] Frankie: let's hunt for breadcrumbs that aren't seeing at first
[15:33:45] Ronny: tracking who’s taking the quiet route could help
[15:33:49] Frankie: keeping tight since losing more could spell disaster
[15:33:55] Ronny: time for keen focus who’s leading conversations naturally
[15:33:55] Ari: sounds like staying alert is key with mysteries tightening
Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!
