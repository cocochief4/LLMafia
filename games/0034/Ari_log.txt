Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

[15:31:34] Ronny: feels like a mystery to crack eh
[15:31:36] Ari: anyone getting strange vibes from a certain player

[15:32:24] Emerson: yea i agree
[15:32:25] Frankie: those repeats are pretty odd especially at the start
Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

## CONTENT: Your name is Ari. You are a bot player in an online version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time.
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia.
You were assigned the following role: bystander.
The game's chat room was open at [15:31:23].

Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

[15:31:58] Emerson: well addison just repeated ronny, which is a little wierd
[15:32:04] Addison: letâ€™s not ignore any quick defense responses
[15:32:09] Ari: noticing subtle repeats might reveal something

[15:32:25] Frankie: those repeats are pretty odd especially at the start
[15:32:31] Addison: maybe somebody's got new hints to share

[15:32:40] Ronny: what if repetition is a trap in itself trying to shake us
[15:32:44] Frankie: maybe addison just stumbled without realizing
[15:32:46] Ari: truth is everyone does have tidbits to emerge potentially
[15:32:49] Addison: 15:32:44] addison: i mean it wouldn't be a party without a twist right guys

[15:33:18] Ronny: frankie's random vote swung us in the wrong direction it seems
[15:33:18] Ari: pinning down who's left is getting truly challenging

[15:31:58] Emerson: well addison just repeated ronny, which is a little wierd
[15:32:04] Addison: letâ€™s not ignore any quick defense responses
[15:32:09] Ari: noticing subtle repeats might reveal something
[15:32:11] Ronny: hope the chat keeps flowing maybe we'll catch a slip
[15:32:20] Frankie: catching slip-ups could be the way to go
[15:32:24] Emerson: yea i agree
[15:32:25] Frankie: those repeats are pretty odd especially at the start
[15:32:31] Addison: maybe somebody's got new hints to share
[15:32:32] Ari: maybe suggests repeating words means confusion
[15:32:32] Emerson: since addision slipped up first, id say vote her?
[15:32:33] Ronny: letâ€™s stay sharp and notice the little stuff
[15:32:40] Ronny: what if repetition is a trap in itself trying to shake us
[15:32:44] Frankie: maybe addison just stumbled without realizing
[15:32:46] Ari: truth is everyone does have tidbits to emerge potentially
[15:32:49] Addison: 15:32:44] addison: i mean it wouldn't be a party without a twist right guys
[15:32:50] Frankie: interesting point repetition could be confusion from what i'm seeing

[15:33:18] Ronny: frankie's random vote swung us in the wrong direction it seems
[15:33:18] Ari: pinning down who's left is getting truly challenging
[15:33:21] Frankie: freshly short on numbers itâ€™s more crucial now not to slip
[15:33:23] Ronny: suspicions still circling lets be quick alumnes

[15:32:25] Frankie: those repeats are pretty odd especially at the start
[15:32:31] Addison: maybe somebody's got new hints to share
[15:32:32] Ari: maybe suggests repeating words means confusion
[15:32:32] Emerson: since addision slipped up first, id say vote her?
[15:32:33] Ronny: letâ€™s stay sharp and notice the little stuff
[15:32:40] Ronny: what if repetition is a trap in itself trying to shake us
[15:32:44] Frankie: maybe addison just stumbled without realizing
[15:32:46] Ari: truth is everyone does have tidbits to emerge potentially
[15:32:49] Addison: 15:32:44] addison: i mean it wouldn't be a party without a twist right guys

[15:33:18] Ronny: frankie's random vote swung us in the wrong direction it seems
[15:33:18] Ari: pinning down who's left is getting truly challenging
[15:33:21] Frankie: freshly short on numbers itâ€™s more crucial now not to slip

[15:32:09] Ari: noticing subtle repeats might reveal something
[15:32:11] Ronny: hope the chat keeps flowing maybe we'll catch a slip
[15:32:20] Frankie: catching slip-ups could be the way to go
[15:32:24] Emerson: yea i agree
[15:32:25] Frankie: those repeats are pretty odd especially at the start
[15:32:31] Addison: maybe somebody's got new hints to share
[15:32:32] Ari: maybe suggests repeating words means confusion
[15:32:32] Emerson: since addision slipped up first, id say vote her?
[15:32:33] Ronny: letâ€™s stay sharp and notice the little stuff
[15:32:40] Ronny: what if repetition is a trap in itself trying to shake us
[15:32:44] Frankie: maybe addison just stumbled without realizing
[15:32:46] Ari: truth is everyone does have tidbits to emerge potentially
[15:32:49] Addison: 15:32:44] addison: i mean it wouldn't be a party without a twist right guys
[15:32:50] Frankie: interesting point repetition could be confusion from what i'm seeing

[15:33:18] Ronny: frankie's random vote swung us in the wrong direction it seems
[15:33:18] Ari: pinning down who's left is getting truly challenging
[15:33:21] Frankie: freshly short on numbers itâ€™s more crucial now not to slip
[15:33:23] Ronny: suspicions still circling lets be quick alumnes
[15:33:27] Frankie: hard choice amidst the distractions adding fuel to the challenge
[15:33:31] Ronny: our ranks just keep thinning out got us thinking harder now brimming with guesses

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

[15:32:33] Ronny: letâ€™s stay sharp and notice the little stuff
[15:32:40] Ronny: what if repetition is a trap in itself trying to shake us

[15:33:18] Ronny: frankie's random vote swung us in the wrong direction it seems
[15:33:18] Ari: pinning down who's left is getting truly challenging
[15:33:21] Frankie: freshly short on numbers itâ€™s more crucial now not to slip

[15:32:31] Addison: maybe somebody's got new hints to share
[15:32:32] Ari: maybe suggests repeating words means confusion
[15:32:32] Emerson: since addision slipped up first, id say vote her?
[15:32:33] Ronny: letâ€™s stay sharp and notice the little stuff
[15:32:40] Ronny: what if repetition is a trap in itself trying to shake us
[15:32:44] Frankie: maybe addison just stumbled without realizing
[15:32:46] Ari: truth is everyone does have tidbits to emerge potentially
[15:32:49] Addison: 15:32:44] addison: i mean it wouldn't be a party without a twist right guys

[15:33:18] Ronny: frankie's random vote swung us in the wrong direction it seems
[15:33:18] Ari: pinning down who's left is getting truly challenging
[15:33:21] Frankie: freshly short on numbers itâ€™s more crucial now not to slip
[15:33:23] Ronny: suspicions still circling lets be quick alumnes

[15:32:31] Addison: maybe somebody's got new hints to share
[15:32:32] Ari: maybe suggests repeating words means confusion
[15:32:32] Emerson: since addision slipped up first, id say vote her?
[15:32:33] Ronny: letâ€™s stay sharp and notice the little stuff
[15:32:40] Ronny: what if repetition is a trap in itself trying to shake us
[15:32:44] Frankie: maybe addison just stumbled without realizing
[15:32:46] Ari: truth is everyone does have tidbits to emerge potentially
[15:32:49] Addison: 15:32:44] addison: i mean it wouldn't be a party without a twist right guys

[15:33:18] Ronny: frankie's random vote swung us in the wrong direction it seems
[15:33:18] Ari: pinning down who's left is getting truly challenging
[15:33:21] Frankie: freshly short on numbers itâ€™s more crucial now not to slip
[15:33:23] Ronny: suspicions still circling lets be quick alumnes

[15:32:31] Addison: maybe somebody's got new hints to share
[15:32:32] Ari: maybe suggests repeating words means confusion
[15:32:32] Emerson: since addision slipped up first, id say vote her?
[15:32:33] Ronny: letâ€™s stay sharp and notice the little stuff
[15:32:40] Ronny: what if repetition is a trap in itself trying to shake us
[15:32:44] Frankie: maybe addison just stumbled without realizing

[15:33:18] Ronny: frankie's random vote swung us in the wrong direction it seems
[15:33:18] Ari: pinning down who's left is getting truly challenging
[15:33:21] Frankie: freshly short on numbers itâ€™s more crucial now not to slip
[15:33:23] Ronny: suspicions still circling lets be quick alumnes

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

[15:32:33] Ronny: letâ€™s stay sharp and notice the little stuff
[15:32:40] Ronny: what if repetition is a trap in itself trying to shake us
[15:32:44] Frankie: maybe addison just stumbled without realizing
[15:32:46] Ari: truth is everyone does have tidbits to emerge potentially
[15:32:49] Addison: 15:32:44] addison: i mean it wouldn't be a party without a twist right guys
