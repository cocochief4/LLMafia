[15:31:26] Addison: let’s catch us some mafias
[15:31:30] Ronny: who's acting a bit sneaky
[15:31:31] Ari: excited to get this started let's figure out who among us is suspicious
[15:31:32] Addison: who's acting a little too sneaky
[15:31:33] Frankie: i’m fired up and ready to untangle this puzzle
[15:31:34] Ronny: feels like a mystery to crack eh
[15:31:36] Ari: anyone getting strange vibes from a certain player
[15:31:37] Emerson: i agree, lets go
[15:31:38] Frankie: clues feel thin right now who's got leads
[15:31:58] Emerson: well addison just repeated ronny, which is a little wierd
[15:32:04] Addison: let’s not ignore any quick defense responses
[15:32:09] Ari: noticing subtle repeats might reveal something
[15:32:11] Ronny: hope the chat keeps flowing maybe we'll catch a slip
[15:32:20] Frankie: catching slip-ups could be the way to go
[15:32:24] Emerson: yea i agree
[15:32:25] Frankie: those repeats are pretty odd especially at the start
[15:32:31] Addison: maybe somebody's got new hints to share
[15:32:32] Ari: maybe suggests repeating words means confusion
[15:32:32] Emerson: since addision slipped up first, id say vote her?
[15:32:33] Ronny: let’s stay sharp and notice the little stuff
[15:32:40] Ronny: what if repetition is a trap in itself trying to shake us
[15:32:44] Frankie: maybe addison just stumbled without realizing
[15:32:46] Ari: truth is everyone does have tidbits to emerge potentially
[15:32:49] Addison: 15:32:44] addison: i mean it wouldn't be a party without a twist right guys
[15:32:50] Frankie: interesting point repetition could be confusion from what i'm seeing
