You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time.\nThe rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia."}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Do you understand the rules?'}]

At Night, the mafia (who know each other) quietly choose a bystander to eliminate. The bystanders don’t know who the mafia are. The mafia win if their numbers ever match or exceed the bystanders’; the bystanders win if they successfully lynch all mafia. Ready to play!
