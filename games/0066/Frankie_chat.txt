[16:03:43] Frankie: i don’t really have a suspect yet—thoughts
[16:03:55] Frankie: emerson’s been awfully quiet—seems kinda suspicious
[16:04:09] Frankie: ari’s been super quiet—does that strike anyone else as odd
[16:04:26] Frankie: feels like someone’s framing alex to cover their own tracks
[16:04:40] Frankie: ronny’s eagerness to point fingers feels off to me
[16:04:59] Frankie: emerson’s fixation on names feels like deflection—and ari’s quick accusation feels defensive
[16:05:30] Frankie: i’m voting ronny—he’s too eager to redirect blame
