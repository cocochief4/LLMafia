[16:03:37] Addison: anyone noticed someone being unusually quiet so far
[16:03:39] Ari: anyone already eyeing someone who’s been too quiet today
[16:03:40] Ronny: let’s get started—any early suspects
[16:03:43] Frankie: i don’t really have a suspect yet—thoughts
[16:03:46] Addison: does anyone have any early suspicions or observations
[16:03:48] Emerson: I'm ready, lets get started finding the mafia
[16:03:50] Ronny: anyone else noticed alex has been silent so far
[16:03:55] Frankie: emerson’s been awfully quiet—seems kinda suspicious
[16:03:56] Emerson: What is alex's last name?
[16:04:01] Ronny: i haven’t heard anything from jordan yet—seems odd
[16:04:04] Ari: alex’s silence really stands out—i’m starting to keep an eye on them
[16:04:09] Frankie: ari’s been super quiet—does that strike anyone else as odd
[16:04:10] Emerson: What is jordan's last name
[16:04:15] Emerson: could you tell me who are all in the game?
[16:04:16] Addison: alex, any thoughts on who seems the most suspicious to you
[16:04:17] Ari: jordan, you haven’t chimed in—any suspects so far
[16:04:26] Frankie: feels like someone’s framing alex to cover their own tracks
[16:04:27] Addison: the players are alex, jordan, ari, frankie, ronny, emerson, and addison
[16:04:32] Ari: honestly, i’m suspicious of frankie for eagerly pointing fingers with no real evidence
[16:04:37] Addison: exactly, someone’s framing alex—who’s actually pulling the strings here
[16:04:40] Frankie: ronny’s eagerness to point fingers feels off to me
[16:04:42] Emerson: Are you sure? I dont remember alex and jordan being in the game
[16:04:43] Ari: emerson, any early reads on who might be mafia
[16:04:44] Ronny: frankie, what’s your reasoning for suspecting emerson and ari so quickly
[16:04:54] Addison: i’m with ari—frankie’s eagerness to point fingers feels off
[16:04:54] Ari: emerson, addison’s right—let’s focus on who’s actually acting strange
[16:04:59] Frankie: emerson’s fixation on names feels like deflection—and ari’s quick accusation feels defensive
[16:05:00] Ronny: jordan, you’ve been silent—who do you suspect
