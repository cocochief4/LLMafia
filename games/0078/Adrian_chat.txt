[21:51:53] Adrian: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:52:01] Adrian: hey everyone, i'm adrian, wondering why finley’s been so quiet this round
[21:52:08] Adrian: i agree, parker’s silence definitely raises a red flag
[21:52:37] Adrian: can someone share a concrete example behind these suspicions instead of just gut feelings
[21:52:48] Adrian: drew, why haven’t you answered finley’s question yet
[21:53:41] Adrian: tyler, what specific action by parker prompted your immediate defense of them
[21:54:00] Adrian: with two minutes left, can each of us name our single strongest piece of evidence for or against parker so we can move to a vote
[21:54:13] Adrian: sidney, can you point to the exact phrase in tyler’s defense of parker that felt off to you
[21:54:29] Adrian: my strongest evidence against parker is their deflection when asked why they abruptly switched suspicion from finley to parker
[21:54:40] Adrian: i’m voting parker for evasion unless they explain why they stayed silent under questioning
[21:56:19] Adrian: why would the mafia target quiet kennedy instead of more vocal players like drew or tyler—anyone have theories
[21:56:34] Adrian: tyler, can you point to the exact lines where sidney defended you twice
[21:56:55] Adrian: sidney, what specific claim of drew’s are you calling vague misdirection
[21:57:13] Adrian: sidney, can you cite the specific line from drew you find vague
[21:57:38] Adrian: drew, can you specify what about tyler’s swift defense of sidney seems most off to you
[21:58:15] Adrian: tyler, is your snap defense of sidney honest or just misdirection
[21:58:34] Adrian: sidney’s constant defense of tyler without offering any evidence strikes me as evasive
[21:58:54] Adrian: drew, give us one concrete behavior to watch for instead of just demanding evidence
[21:59:40] Adrian: i’m voting sidney for repeatedly defending tyler without any proof
