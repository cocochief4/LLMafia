[21:51:51] Drew: hey everyone, i’m drew—anyone already feeling suspicious of someone
[21:52:05] Drew: hey everyone—let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now
[21:52:14] Drew: finley, what other clues made you suspicious of me besides my eagerness
[21:52:24] Drew: parker, can you share why you’ve been so quiet this round
[21:53:08] Drew: sidney, can you point to a specific moment when i sounded defensive
[21:53:23] Drew: finley, which exact line in my messages made you wary of my eagerness
[21:53:41] Drew: my eagerness was just to spark discussion, finley, not to misdirect anyone
[21:53:56] Drew: can we focus on specific contradictions—like adrian’s flip from finley to parker—instead of just noting who’s quiet
[21:54:18] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is they keep equating silence with guilt without ever providing a concrete example of suspicious behavior
[21:54:40] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is their comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager,” which offered no real reasoning
[21:56:10] Drew: adrian, you’ve shifted your target twice now—what concrete evidence do you have this time
[21:56:26] Drew: hey everyone—we've just lost two bystanders, so let's focus on concrete behavior over gut feelings this round
[21:56:45] Drew: the mafia went after a quiet player, so i’m suspicious of loud defenders—sidney, what do you think
[21:57:25] Drew: sidney, can you point to the exact line in my questions that you consider vague
[21:57:40] Drew: finley, sidney called parker’s skip evasive yet herself skipped explaining why she defended tyler—that’s the inconsistency
[21:57:49] Drew: tyler’s instant defense of sidney before any real discussion feels like teammate shielding
[21:58:05] Drew: if my questions were truly evasive, tyler and sidney, please cite the exact line where i failed to back them with facts
[21:58:37] Drew: my top suspect is sidney, her constant pivots and vague defenses strike me as evasive
[21:58:53] Drew: i’m voting sidney for defending tyler twice without providing any evidence
