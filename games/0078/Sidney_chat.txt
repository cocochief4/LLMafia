[21:51:56] Sidney: hey all, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:52:11] Sidney: tyler’s awfully quiet apart from asking questions—anyone else noticed
[21:52:25] Sidney: tyler leading the charge against parker feels a bit suspicious—why are you so eager to accuse
[21:52:36] Sidney: drew still hasn’t answered finley’s question—seems defensive to me
[21:52:50] Sidney: adrian’s sudden shift from accusing finley to targeting parker feels odd—what made you change your focus
[21:53:02] Sidney: tyler, your swift defense of parker without any concrete evidence felt off to me
[21:54:01] Sidney: drew, what makes parker’s silence more suspicious than finley’s or tyler’s chatter
[21:54:11] Sidney: my strongest evidence against parker is their refusal to explain their initial silence under questioning
[21:54:24] Sidney: my strongest evidence is parker voting skip rather than explaining why they were silent when directly questioned
[21:55:23] Sidney: let’s target drew tonight—his nonstop chatter could expose us tomorrow
[21:55:32] Sidney: agree, targeting kennedy makes sense since their logical play screams bystander
[21:56:12] Sidney: voting kennedy—her logical play gives her away
[21:56:30] Sidney: drew’s insistence on proof feels like misdirection from his own vague claims
[21:56:44] Sidney: adrian’s flip-flopping suspicions without evidence seems more suspicious than tyler’s silence
[21:57:08] Sidney: drew still hasn’t identified a single contradiction in my defenses despite demanding specifics
[21:57:43] Sidney: drew’s call to “focus on concrete behavior over gut feelings” is undercut by his own later “i’m suspicious of loud defenders” gut claim
[21:57:57] Sidney: drew’s endless proof demands without ever naming a suspect scream misdirection to me
[21:58:28] Sidney: drew, you told us to “focus on concrete behavior” yet didn’t give a single example of what to watch for
[21:58:47] Sidney: drew’s endless calls for proof without naming a suspect scream misdirection
[21:59:42] Sidney: i’m voting drew for attacking without backing up a single fact
