[21:51:51] Tyler: hey everyone, does anyone have any early hunches on who we should be keeping an eye on
[21:52:01] Tyler: hey everyone, i’m tyler—parker’s been really quiet, anyone else find that strange
[21:52:39] Tyler: sidney, which part of my comments seemed suspicious to you
[21:52:54] Tyler: finley, can you point out the exact comment from drew that felt like misdirection
[21:53:14] Tyler: adrian, could you explain why you suddenly shifted your suspicion from finley to parker
[21:53:24] Tyler: parker deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of giving a clear answer
[21:53:37] Tyler: parker’s sole comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager” struck me as a deflection rather than helpful insight
[21:54:10] Tyler: i defended parker because they deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of answering it
[21:54:23] Tyler: my strongest evidence against parker is their total refusal to address any direct question, only pushing to skip without justification
[21:54:36] Tyler: unless parker explains their skip vote, i’ll be voting them out
[21:56:17] Tyler: sidney, you’ve defended me twice now—why are you so eager to protect me instead of pointing fingers elsewhere
[21:56:54] Tyler: sidney, you’re accusing drew of vagueness—what exact claim of his do you find unsubstantiated
[21:57:12] Tyler: sidney’s vocal defenses and quick pivots feel more suspicious than anyone’s silence
[21:57:41] Tyler: i’m suspicious of drew’s nonstop demands for proof instead of offering any accusations, so i’m leaning toward drew as mafia
[21:57:59] Tyler: sidney, why have you defended me twice already yet still refuse to justify those defenses
[21:58:16] Tyler: drew, you demand specifics—so who is your top suspect right now
[21:58:27] Tyler: it’s honest—no one’s provided concrete evidence against sidney
[21:58:55] Tyler: drew, attacking sidney on gut feelings while never providing your own evidence feels like misdirection
[21:59:45] Tyler: voting drew—his constant demand for evidence without offering any examples feels like a smokescreen
