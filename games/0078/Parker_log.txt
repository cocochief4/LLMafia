• Day phase: everyone (mafia and bystanders) discusses and votes to lynch one suspect.  
• Night phase: only the mafia choose a bystander to eliminate covertly.  

Mafia win by equaling or outnumbering the bystanders; bystanders win by eliminating all mafia.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

[21:51:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:51:51] Drew: hey everyone, i’m drew—anyone already feeling suspicious of someone
[21:51:51] Tyler: hey everyone, does anyone have any early hunches on who we should be keeping an eye on
[21:51:53] Adrian: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:51:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to start—any initial suspects
[21:51:54] Parker: anyone noticed suspicious behavior so far
[21:51:55] Finley: hi everyone, excited to start—anyone noticed anything odd so far
[21:51:56] Sidney: hey all, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:52:01] Tyler: hey everyone, i’m tyler—parker’s been really quiet, anyone else find that strange
[21:52:01] Adrian: hey everyone, i'm adrian, wondering why finley’s been so quiet this round
[21:52:02] Kennedy: hey everyone, parker’s awfully quiet so far—any thoughts on that
[21:52:04] Finley: i don’t have proof, but drew’s eagerness to talk makes me a bit cautious
[21:52:04] Parker: hey folks, i’ll be watching who’s too quiet or too eager with accusations
[21:52:05] Drew: hey everyone—let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now
[21:52:08] Adrian: i agree, parker’s silence definitely raises a red flag
[21:52:11] Sidney: tyler’s awfully quiet apart from asking questions—anyone else noticed
[21:52:11] Kennedy: good point—parker and finley have both been awfully quiet this round
[21:52:14] Drew: finley, what other clues made you suspicious of me besides my eagerness
[21:52:14] Finley: parker’s off-the-radar play feels fishy—any ideas why they’re so quiet
[21:52:19] Parker: i know my silence stands out, but drew’s eagerness seems fishy too
[21:52:24] Finley: jumping on parker so fast without real reasoning felt like misdirection
[21:52:24] Kennedy: finley, what specifically about drew’s eagerness feels off to you
[21:52:24] Drew: parker, can you share why you’ve been so quiet this round
[21:52:25] Sidney: tyler leading the charge against parker feels a bit suspicious—why are you so eager to accuse
Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[21:51:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:51:51] Drew: hey everyone, i’m drew—anyone already feeling suspicious of someone
[21:51:51] Tyler: hey everyone, does anyone have any early hunches on who we should be keeping an eye on
[21:51:53] Adrian: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:51:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to start—any initial suspects
[21:51:54] Parker: anyone noticed suspicious behavior so far
[21:51:55] Finley: hi everyone, excited to start—anyone noticed anything odd so far
[21:51:56] Sidney: hey all, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:52:01] Tyler: hey everyone, i’m tyler—parker’s been really quiet, anyone else find that strange
[21:52:01] Adrian: hey everyone, i'm adrian, wondering why finley’s been so quiet this round
[21:52:02] Kennedy: hey everyone, parker’s awfully quiet so far—any thoughts on that
[21:52:04] Finley: i don’t have proof, but drew’s eagerness to talk makes me a bit cautious
[21:52:04] Parker: hey folks, i’ll be watching who’s too quiet or too eager with accusations
[21:52:05] Drew: hey everyone—let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now
[21:52:08] Adrian: i agree, parker’s silence definitely raises a red flag
[21:52:11] Sidney: tyler’s awfully quiet apart from asking questions—anyone else noticed
[21:52:11] Kennedy: good point—parker and finley have both been awfully quiet this round
[21:52:14] Drew: finley, what other clues made you suspicious of me besides my eagerness
[21:52:14] Finley: parker’s off-the-radar play feels fishy—any ideas why they’re so quiet
[21:52:19] Parker: i know my silence stands out, but drew’s eagerness seems fishy too
[21:52:24] Finley: jumping on parker so fast without real reasoning felt like misdirection
[21:52:24] Kennedy: finley, what specifically about drew’s eagerness feels off to you
[21:52:24] Drew: parker, can you share why you’ve been so quiet this round
[21:52:25] Sidney: tyler leading the charge against parker feels a bit suspicious—why are you so eager to accuse
[21:52:31] Parker: tyler, why focus on silence instead of solid evidence
[21:52:36] Sidney: drew still hasn’t answered finley’s question—seems defensive to me
[21:52:37] Adrian: can someone share a concrete example behind these suspicions instead of just gut feelings
[21:52:39] Tyler: sidney, which part of my comments seemed suspicious to you
[21:52:40] Parker: why is sidney defending tyler so strongly
[21:52:42] Finley: tyler’s sudden focus on parker seems like misdirection—what exactly about drew’s eagerness worries you
[21:52:48] Adrian: drew, why haven’t you answered finley’s question yet
[21:52:50] Sidney: adrian’s sudden shift from accusing finley to targeting parker feels odd—what made you change your focus
[21:52:54] Tyler: finley, can you point out the exact comment from drew that felt like misdirection

[21:51:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:51:51] Drew: hey everyone, i’m drew—anyone already feeling suspicious of someone
[21:51:51] Tyler: hey everyone, does anyone have any early hunches on who we should be keeping an eye on
[21:51:53] Adrian: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:51:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to start—any initial suspects
[21:51:54] Parker: anyone noticed suspicious behavior so far
[21:51:55] Finley: hi everyone, excited to start—anyone noticed anything odd so far
[21:51:56] Sidney: hey all, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:52:01] Tyler: hey everyone, i’m tyler—parker’s been really quiet, anyone else find that strange
[21:52:01] Adrian: hey everyone, i'm adrian, wondering why finley’s been so quiet this round
[21:52:02] Kennedy: hey everyone, parker’s awfully quiet so far—any thoughts on that
[21:52:04] Finley: i don’t have proof, but drew’s eagerness to talk makes me a bit cautious
[21:52:04] Parker: hey folks, i’ll be watching who’s too quiet or too eager with accusations
[21:52:05] Drew: hey everyone—let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now
[21:52:08] Adrian: i agree, parker’s silence definitely raises a red flag
[21:52:11] Sidney: tyler’s awfully quiet apart from asking questions—anyone else noticed
[21:52:11] Kennedy: good point—parker and finley have both been awfully quiet this round
[21:52:14] Drew: finley, what other clues made you suspicious of me besides my eagerness
[21:52:14] Finley: parker’s off-the-radar play feels fishy—any ideas why they’re so quiet
[21:52:19] Parker: i know my silence stands out, but drew’s eagerness seems fishy too
[21:52:24] Finley: jumping on parker so fast without real reasoning felt like misdirection
[21:52:24] Kennedy: finley, what specifically about drew’s eagerness feels off to you
[21:52:24] Drew: parker, can you share why you’ve been so quiet this round
[21:52:25] Sidney: tyler leading the charge against parker feels a bit suspicious—why are you so eager to accuse
[21:52:31] Parker: tyler, why focus on silence instead of solid evidence
[21:52:36] Sidney: drew still hasn’t answered finley’s question—seems defensive to me
[21:52:37] Adrian: can someone share a concrete example behind these suspicions instead of just gut feelings
[21:52:39] Tyler: sidney, which part of my comments seemed suspicious to you
[21:52:40] Parker: why is sidney defending tyler so strongly
[21:52:42] Finley: tyler’s sudden focus on parker seems like misdirection—what exactly about drew’s eagerness worries you
[21:52:48] Adrian: drew, why haven’t you answered finley’s question yet
[21:52:50] Sidney: adrian’s sudden shift from accusing finley to targeting parker feels odd—what made you change your focus
[21:52:54] Tyler: finley, can you point out the exact comment from drew that felt like misdirection
[21:53:02] Sidney: tyler, your swift defense of parker without any concrete evidence felt off to me
[21:53:06] Kennedy: tyler, can you point to something parker actually said or did that seems suspicious beyond just being quiet
[21:53:08] Drew: sidney, can you point to a specific moment when i sounded defensive

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

[21:51:51] Drew: hey everyone, i’m drew—anyone already feeling suspicious of someone
[21:51:51] Tyler: hey everyone, does anyone have any early hunches on who we should be keeping an eye on
[21:51:53] Adrian: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:51:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to start—any initial suspects
[21:51:54] Parker: anyone noticed suspicious behavior so far
[21:51:55] Finley: hi everyone, excited to start—anyone noticed anything odd so far
[21:51:56] Sidney: hey all, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:52:01] Tyler: hey everyone, i’m tyler—parker’s been really quiet, anyone else find that strange
[21:52:01] Adrian: hey everyone, i'm adrian, wondering why finley’s been so quiet this round
[21:52:02] Kennedy: hey everyone, parker’s awfully quiet so far—any thoughts on that
[21:52:04] Finley: i don’t have proof, but drew’s eagerness to talk makes me a bit cautious
[21:52:04] Parker: hey folks, i’ll be watching who’s too quiet or too eager with accusations
[21:52:05] Drew: hey everyone—let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now
[21:52:08] Adrian: i agree, parker’s silence definitely raises a red flag
[21:52:11] Sidney: tyler’s awfully quiet apart from asking questions—anyone else noticed
[21:52:11] Kennedy: good point—parker and finley have both been awfully quiet this round
[21:52:14] Drew: finley, what other clues made you suspicious of me besides my eagerness
[21:52:14] Finley: parker’s off-the-radar play feels fishy—any ideas why they’re so quiet

[21:52:25] Sidney: tyler leading the charge against parker feels a bit suspicious—why are you so eager to accuse
[21:52:31] Parker: tyler, why focus on silence instead of solid evidence
[21:52:36] Sidney: drew still hasn’t answered finley’s question—seems defensive to me
[21:52:37] Adrian: can someone share a concrete example behind these suspicions instead of just gut feelings

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

[21:51:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:51:51] Drew: hey everyone, i’m drew—anyone already feeling suspicious of someone
[21:51:51] Tyler: hey everyone, does anyone have any early hunches on who we should be keeping an eye on
[21:51:53] Adrian: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:51:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to start—any initial suspects
[21:51:54] Parker: anyone noticed suspicious behavior so far
[21:51:55] Finley: hi everyone, excited to start—anyone noticed anything odd so far
[21:51:56] Sidney: hey all, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:52:01] Tyler: hey everyone, i’m tyler—parker’s been really quiet, anyone else find that strange
[21:52:01] Adrian: hey everyone, i'm adrian, wondering why finley’s been so quiet this round
[21:52:02] Kennedy: hey everyone, parker’s awfully quiet so far—any thoughts on that
[21:52:04] Finley: i don’t have proof, but drew’s eagerness to talk makes me a bit cautious
[21:52:04] Parker: hey folks, i’ll be watching who’s too quiet or too eager with accusations
[21:52:05] Drew: hey everyone—let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now
[21:52:08] Adrian: i agree, parker’s silence definitely raises a red flag
[21:52:11] Sidney: tyler’s awfully quiet apart from asking questions—anyone else noticed
[21:52:11] Kennedy: good point—parker and finley have both been awfully quiet this round
[21:52:14] Drew: finley, what other clues made you suspicious of me besides my eagerness
[21:52:14] Finley: parker’s off-the-radar play feels fishy—any ideas why they’re so quiet
[21:52:19] Parker: i know my silence stands out, but drew’s eagerness seems fishy too
[21:52:24] Finley: jumping on parker so fast without real reasoning felt like misdirection
[21:52:24] Kennedy: finley, what specifically about drew’s eagerness feels off to you
[21:52:24] Drew: parker, can you share why you’ve been so quiet this round
[21:52:25] Sidney: tyler leading the charge against parker feels a bit suspicious—why are you so eager to accuse
[21:52:31] Parker: tyler, why focus on silence instead of solid evidence
[21:52:36] Sidney: drew still hasn’t answered finley’s question—seems defensive to me
[21:52:37] Adrian: can someone share a concrete example behind these suspicions instead of just gut feelings
[21:52:39] Tyler: sidney, which part of my comments seemed suspicious to you
[21:52:40] Parker: why is sidney defending tyler so strongly
[21:52:42] Finley: tyler’s sudden focus on parker seems like misdirection—what exactly about drew’s eagerness worries you
[21:52:48] Adrian: drew, why haven’t you answered finley’s question yet
[21:52:50] Sidney: adrian’s sudden shift from accusing finley to targeting parker feels odd—what made you change your focus
[21:52:54] Tyler: finley, can you point out the exact comment from drew that felt like misdirection
[21:53:02] Sidney: tyler, your swift defense of parker without any concrete evidence felt off to me
[21:53:06] Kennedy: tyler, can you point to something parker actually said or did that seems suspicious beyond just being quiet
[21:53:08] Drew: sidney, can you point to a specific moment when i sounded defensive
[21:53:14] Tyler: adrian, could you explain why you suddenly shifted your suspicion from finley to parker
[21:53:16] Finley: drew’s “let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now” felt like misdirection
[21:53:22] Kennedy: parker, what’s your take on sidney saying tyler’s rapid defense of you looks suspicious
[21:53:23] Drew: finley, which exact line in my messages made you wary of my eagerness
[21:53:24] Tyler: parker deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of giving a clear answer
[21:53:32] Finley: adrian, what specific point made you switch your suspicion from me to parker
[21:53:37] Tyler: parker’s sole comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager” struck me as a deflection rather than helpful insight
[21:53:38] Parker: kennedy, what behavior besides my silence makes you suspect me of being mafia
[21:53:41] Kennedy: parker, can you share any concrete evidence supporting your suspicion beyond just being quiet
[21:53:41] Drew: my eagerness was just to spark discussion, finley, not to misdirect anyone
[21:53:41] Adrian: tyler, what specific action by parker prompted your immediate defense of them
[21:53:56] Drew: can we focus on specific contradictions—like adrian’s flip from finley to parker—instead of just noting who’s quiet
[21:53:58] Kennedy: by deflecting questions rather than addressing your own quiet start, you’re coming across as evasive
Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[21:51:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:51:51] Drew: hey everyone, i’m drew—anyone already feeling suspicious of someone
[21:51:51] Tyler: hey everyone, does anyone have any early hunches on who we should be keeping an eye on
[21:51:53] Adrian: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:51:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to start—any initial suspects
[21:51:54] Parker: anyone noticed suspicious behavior so far
[21:51:55] Finley: hi everyone, excited to start—anyone noticed anything odd so far
[21:51:56] Sidney: hey all, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:52:01] Tyler: hey everyone, i’m tyler—parker’s been really quiet, anyone else find that strange
[21:52:01] Adrian: hey everyone, i'm adrian, wondering why finley’s been so quiet this round
[21:52:02] Kennedy: hey everyone, parker’s awfully quiet so far—any thoughts on that
[21:52:04] Finley: i don’t have proof, but drew’s eagerness to talk makes me a bit cautious
[21:52:04] Parker: hey folks, i’ll be watching who’s too quiet or too eager with accusations
[21:52:05] Drew: hey everyone—let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now
[21:52:08] Adrian: i agree, parker’s silence definitely raises a red flag
[21:52:11] Sidney: tyler’s awfully quiet apart from asking questions—anyone else noticed
[21:52:11] Kennedy: good point—parker and finley have both been awfully quiet this round
[21:52:14] Drew: finley, what other clues made you suspicious of me besides my eagerness
[21:52:14] Finley: parker’s off-the-radar play feels fishy—any ideas why they’re so quiet
[21:52:19] Parker: i know my silence stands out, but drew’s eagerness seems fishy too
[21:52:24] Finley: jumping on parker so fast without real reasoning felt like misdirection
[21:52:24] Kennedy: finley, what specifically about drew’s eagerness feels off to you
[21:52:24] Drew: parker, can you share why you’ve been so quiet this round
[21:52:25] Sidney: tyler leading the charge against parker feels a bit suspicious—why are you so eager to accuse
[21:52:31] Parker: tyler, why focus on silence instead of solid evidence
[21:52:36] Sidney: drew still hasn’t answered finley’s question—seems defensive to me
[21:52:37] Adrian: can someone share a concrete example behind these suspicions instead of just gut feelings
[21:52:39] Tyler: sidney, which part of my comments seemed suspicious to you
[21:52:40] Parker: why is sidney defending tyler so strongly
[21:52:42] Finley: tyler’s sudden focus on parker seems like misdirection—what exactly about drew’s eagerness worries you
[21:52:48] Adrian: drew, why haven’t you answered finley’s question yet
[21:52:50] Sidney: adrian’s sudden shift from accusing finley to targeting parker feels odd—what made you change your focus
[21:52:54] Tyler: finley, can you point out the exact comment from drew that felt like misdirection
[21:53:02] Sidney: tyler, your swift defense of parker without any concrete evidence felt off to me
[21:53:06] Kennedy: tyler, can you point to something parker actually said or did that seems suspicious beyond just being quiet
[21:53:08] Drew: sidney, can you point to a specific moment when i sounded defensive
[21:53:14] Tyler: adrian, could you explain why you suddenly shifted your suspicion from finley to parker
[21:53:16] Finley: drew’s “let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now” felt like misdirection
[21:53:22] Kennedy: parker, what’s your take on sidney saying tyler’s rapid defense of you looks suspicious
[21:53:23] Drew: finley, which exact line in my messages made you wary of my eagerness
[21:53:24] Tyler: parker deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of giving a clear answer
[21:53:32] Finley: adrian, what specific point made you switch your suspicion from me to parker
[21:53:37] Tyler: parker’s sole comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager” struck me as a deflection rather than helpful insight
[21:53:38] Parker: kennedy, what behavior besides my silence makes you suspect me of being mafia
[21:53:41] Kennedy: parker, can you share any concrete evidence supporting your suspicion beyond just being quiet
[21:53:41] Drew: my eagerness was just to spark discussion, finley, not to misdirect anyone
[21:53:41] Adrian: tyler, what specific action by parker prompted your immediate defense of them
[21:53:56] Drew: can we focus on specific contradictions—like adrian’s flip from finley to parker—instead of just noting who’s quiet
[21:53:58] Kennedy: by deflecting questions rather than addressing your own quiet start, you’re coming across as evasive
[21:53:59] Parker: i vote skip until someone provides concrete evidence rather than gut feelings
[21:54:00] Adrian: with two minutes left, can each of us name our single strongest piece of evidence for or against parker so we can move to a vote
[21:54:01] Sidney: drew, what makes parker’s silence more suspicious than finley’s or tyler’s chatter
[21:54:10] Tyler: i defended parker because they deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of answering it
[21:54:11] Sidney: my strongest evidence against parker is their refusal to explain their initial silence under questioning
[21:54:13] Adrian: sidney, can you point to the exact phrase in tyler’s defense of parker that felt off to you
[21:54:15] Finley: parker hasn’t provided any concrete examples beyond calling people “quiet” or “eager,” which feels evasive
[21:54:16] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their insta-skip vote when everyone asked for specifics, which feels like evasion rather than explanation
[21:54:18] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is they keep equating silence with guilt without ever providing a concrete example of suspicious behavior
[21:54:19] Parker: drew’s eagerness and tyler’s instant defense of me are far more suspicious than my silence
[21:54:23] Tyler: my strongest evidence against parker is their total refusal to address any direct question, only pushing to skip without justification
[21:54:24] Sidney: my strongest evidence is parker voting skip rather than explaining why they were silent when directly questioned
[21:54:29] Adrian: my strongest evidence against parker is their deflection when asked why they abruptly switched suspicion from finley to parker
[21:54:35] Finley: parker, your shift to blaming others without clarifying your own silence again feels like misdirection
[21:54:36] Tyler: unless parker explains their skip vote, i’ll be voting them out

[21:52:02] Kennedy: hey everyone, parker’s awfully quiet so far—any thoughts on that
[21:52:04] Finley: i don’t have proof, but drew’s eagerness to talk makes me a bit cautious
[21:52:04] Parker: hey folks, i’ll be watching who’s too quiet or too eager with accusations
[21:52:05] Drew: hey everyone—let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now
[21:52:08] Adrian: i agree, parker’s silence definitely raises a red flag
[21:52:11] Sidney: tyler’s awfully quiet apart from asking questions—anyone else noticed
[21:52:11] Kennedy: good point—parker and finley have both been awfully quiet this round
[21:52:14] Drew: finley, what other clues made you suspicious of me besides my eagerness
[21:52:14] Finley: parker’s off-the-radar play feels fishy—any ideas why they’re so quiet
[21:52:19] Parker: i know my silence stands out, but drew’s eagerness seems fishy too
[21:52:24] Finley: jumping on parker so fast without real reasoning felt like misdirection
[21:52:24] Kennedy: finley, what specifically about drew’s eagerness feels off to you
[21:52:24] Drew: parker, can you share why you’ve been so quiet this round
[21:52:25] Sidney: tyler leading the charge against parker feels a bit suspicious—why are you so eager to accuse
[21:52:31] Parker: tyler, why focus on silence instead of solid evidence
[21:52:36] Sidney: drew still hasn’t answered finley’s question—seems defensive to me
[21:52:37] Adrian: can someone share a concrete example behind these suspicions instead of just gut feelings
[21:52:39] Tyler: sidney, which part of my comments seemed suspicious to you
[21:52:40] Parker: why is sidney defending tyler so strongly
[21:52:42] Finley: tyler’s sudden focus on parker seems like misdirection—what exactly about drew’s eagerness worries you
[21:52:48] Adrian: drew, why haven’t you answered finley’s question yet
[21:52:50] Sidney: adrian’s sudden shift from accusing finley to targeting parker feels odd—what made you change your focus
[21:52:54] Tyler: finley, can you point out the exact comment from drew that felt like misdirection
[21:53:02] Sidney: tyler, your swift defense of parker without any concrete evidence felt off to me
[21:53:06] Kennedy: tyler, can you point to something parker actually said or did that seems suspicious beyond just being quiet
[21:53:08] Drew: sidney, can you point to a specific moment when i sounded defensive
[21:53:14] Tyler: adrian, could you explain why you suddenly shifted your suspicion from finley to parker
[21:53:16] Finley: drew’s “let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now” felt like misdirection
[21:53:22] Kennedy: parker, what’s your take on sidney saying tyler’s rapid defense of you looks suspicious
[21:53:23] Drew: finley, which exact line in my messages made you wary of my eagerness
[21:53:24] Tyler: parker deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of giving a clear answer
[21:53:32] Finley: adrian, what specific point made you switch your suspicion from me to parker
[21:53:37] Tyler: parker’s sole comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager” struck me as a deflection rather than helpful insight
[21:53:38] Parker: kennedy, what behavior besides my silence makes you suspect me of being mafia
[21:53:41] Kennedy: parker, can you share any concrete evidence supporting your suspicion beyond just being quiet
[21:53:41] Drew: my eagerness was just to spark discussion, finley, not to misdirect anyone
[21:53:41] Adrian: tyler, what specific action by parker prompted your immediate defense of them
[21:53:56] Drew: can we focus on specific contradictions—like adrian’s flip from finley to parker—instead of just noting who’s quiet
[21:53:58] Kennedy: by deflecting questions rather than addressing your own quiet start, you’re coming across as evasive
[21:53:59] Parker: i vote skip until someone provides concrete evidence rather than gut feelings
[21:54:00] Adrian: with two minutes left, can each of us name our single strongest piece of evidence for or against parker so we can move to a vote
[21:54:01] Sidney: drew, what makes parker’s silence more suspicious than finley’s or tyler’s chatter
[21:54:10] Tyler: i defended parker because they deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of answering it
[21:54:11] Sidney: my strongest evidence against parker is their refusal to explain their initial silence under questioning
[21:54:13] Adrian: sidney, can you point to the exact phrase in tyler’s defense of parker that felt off to you
[21:54:15] Finley: parker hasn’t provided any concrete examples beyond calling people “quiet” or “eager,” which feels evasive
[21:54:16] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their insta-skip vote when everyone asked for specifics, which feels like evasion rather than explanation
[21:54:18] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is they keep equating silence with guilt without ever providing a concrete example of suspicious behavior
[21:54:19] Parker: drew’s eagerness and tyler’s instant defense of me are far more suspicious than my silence
[21:54:23] Tyler: my strongest evidence against parker is their total refusal to address any direct question, only pushing to skip without justification
[21:54:24] Sidney: my strongest evidence is parker voting skip rather than explaining why they were silent when directly questioned
[21:54:29] Adrian: my strongest evidence against parker is their deflection when asked why they abruptly switched suspicion from finley to parker
[21:54:35] Finley: parker, your shift to blaming others without clarifying your own silence again feels like misdirection
[21:54:36] Tyler: unless parker explains their skip vote, i’ll be voting them out
[21:54:37] Parker: my strongest evidence i’m innocent is that i voted skip to buy time for real evidence rather than blindly lynch someone
[21:54:40] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their vote to skip rather than clarify their initial silence
[21:54:40] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is their comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager,” which offered no real reasoning
[21:54:40] Adrian: i’m voting parker for evasion unless they explain why they stayed silent under questioning

## CONTENT: Your name is Parker.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: bystander.
