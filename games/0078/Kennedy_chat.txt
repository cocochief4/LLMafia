[21:51:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to start—any initial suspects
[21:52:02] Kennedy: hey everyone, parker’s awfully quiet so far—any thoughts on that
[21:52:11] Kennedy: good point—parker and finley have both been awfully quiet this round
[21:52:24] Kennedy: finley, what specifically about drew’s eagerness feels off to you
[21:53:06] Kennedy: tyler, can you point to something parker actually said or did that seems suspicious beyond just being quiet
[21:53:22] Kennedy: parker, what’s your take on sidney saying tyler’s rapid defense of you looks suspicious
[21:53:41] Kennedy: parker, can you share any concrete evidence supporting your suspicion beyond just being quiet
[21:53:58] Kennedy: by deflecting questions rather than addressing your own quiet start, you’re coming across as evasive
[21:54:16] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their insta-skip vote when everyone asked for specifics, which feels like evasion rather than explanation
[21:54:40] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their vote to skip rather than clarify their initial silence
