[21:51:51] Drew: hey everyone, i’m drew—anyone already feeling suspicious of someone
[21:51:51] Tyler: hey everyone, does anyone have any early hunches on who we should be keeping an eye on
[21:51:53] Adrian: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:51:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to start—any initial suspects
[21:51:54] Parker: anyone noticed suspicious behavior so far
[21:51:55] Finley: hi everyone, excited to start—anyone noticed anything odd so far
[21:51:56] Sidney: hey all, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:52:01] Tyler: hey everyone, i’m tyler—parker’s been really quiet, anyone else find that strange
[21:52:01] Adrian: hey everyone, i'm adrian, wondering why finley’s been so quiet this round
[21:52:02] Kennedy: hey everyone, parker’s awfully quiet so far—any thoughts on that
[21:52:04] Finley: i don’t have proof, but drew’s eagerness to talk makes me a bit cautious
[21:52:04] Parker: hey folks, i’ll be watching who’s too quiet or too eager with accusations
[21:52:05] Drew: hey everyone—let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now
[21:52:08] Adrian: i agree, parker’s silence definitely raises a red flag
[21:52:11] Sidney: tyler’s awfully quiet apart from asking questions—anyone else noticed
[21:52:11] Kennedy: good point—parker and finley have both been awfully quiet this round
[21:52:14] Drew: finley, what other clues made you suspicious of me besides my eagerness
[21:52:14] Finley: parker’s off-the-radar play feels fishy—any ideas why they’re so quiet
[21:52:19] Parker: i know my silence stands out, but drew’s eagerness seems fishy too
[21:52:24] Finley: jumping on parker so fast without real reasoning felt like misdirection
[21:52:24] Kennedy: finley, what specifically about drew’s eagerness feels off to you
[21:52:24] Drew: parker, can you share why you’ve been so quiet this round
[21:52:25] Sidney: tyler leading the charge against parker feels a bit suspicious—why are you so eager to accuse
[21:52:31] Parker: tyler, why focus on silence instead of solid evidence
[21:52:36] Sidney: drew still hasn’t answered finley’s question—seems defensive to me
[21:52:37] Adrian: can someone share a concrete example behind these suspicions instead of just gut feelings
[21:52:39] Tyler: sidney, which part of my comments seemed suspicious to you
[21:52:40] Parker: why is sidney defending tyler so strongly
[21:52:42] Finley: tyler’s sudden focus on parker seems like misdirection—what exactly about drew’s eagerness worries you
[21:52:48] Adrian: drew, why haven’t you answered finley’s question yet
[21:52:50] Sidney: adrian’s sudden shift from accusing finley to targeting parker feels odd—what made you change your focus
[21:52:54] Tyler: finley, can you point out the exact comment from drew that felt like misdirection
[21:53:02] Sidney: tyler, your swift defense of parker without any concrete evidence felt off to me
[21:53:06] Kennedy: tyler, can you point to something parker actually said or did that seems suspicious beyond just being quiet
[21:53:08] Drew: sidney, can you point to a specific moment when i sounded defensive
[21:53:14] Tyler: adrian, could you explain why you suddenly shifted your suspicion from finley to parker
[21:53:16] Finley: drew’s “let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now” felt like misdirection
[21:53:22] Kennedy: parker, what’s your take on sidney saying tyler’s rapid defense of you looks suspicious
[21:53:23] Drew: finley, which exact line in my messages made you wary of my eagerness
[21:53:24] Tyler: parker deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of giving a clear answer
[21:53:32] Finley: adrian, what specific point made you switch your suspicion from me to parker
[21:53:37] Tyler: parker’s sole comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager” struck me as a deflection rather than helpful insight
[21:53:38] Parker: kennedy, what behavior besides my silence makes you suspect me of being mafia
[21:53:41] Kennedy: parker, can you share any concrete evidence supporting your suspicion beyond just being quiet
[21:53:41] Drew: my eagerness was just to spark discussion, finley, not to misdirect anyone
[21:53:41] Adrian: tyler, what specific action by parker prompted your immediate defense of them
[21:53:56] Drew: can we focus on specific contradictions—like adrian’s flip from finley to parker—instead of just noting who’s quiet
[21:53:58] Kennedy: by deflecting questions rather than addressing your own quiet start, you’re coming across as evasive
[21:53:59] Parker: i vote skip until someone provides concrete evidence rather than gut feelings
[21:54:00] Adrian: with two minutes left, can each of us name our single strongest piece of evidence for or against parker so we can move to a vote
[21:54:01] Sidney: drew, what makes parker’s silence more suspicious than finley’s or tyler’s chatter
[21:54:10] Tyler: i defended parker because they deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of answering it
[21:54:11] Sidney: my strongest evidence against parker is their refusal to explain their initial silence under questioning
[21:54:13] Adrian: sidney, can you point to the exact phrase in tyler’s defense of parker that felt off to you
[21:54:15] Finley: parker hasn’t provided any concrete examples beyond calling people “quiet” or “eager,” which feels evasive
[21:54:16] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their insta-skip vote when everyone asked for specifics, which feels like evasion rather than explanation
[21:54:18] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is they keep equating silence with guilt without ever providing a concrete example of suspicious behavior
[21:54:19] Parker: drew’s eagerness and tyler’s instant defense of me are far more suspicious than my silence
[21:54:23] Tyler: my strongest evidence against parker is their total refusal to address any direct question, only pushing to skip without justification
[21:54:24] Sidney: my strongest evidence is parker voting skip rather than explaining why they were silent when directly questioned
[21:54:29] Adrian: my strongest evidence against parker is their deflection when asked why they abruptly switched suspicion from finley to parker
[21:54:35] Finley: parker, your shift to blaming others without clarifying your own silence again feels like misdirection
[21:54:36] Tyler: unless parker explains their skip vote, i’ll be voting them out
[21:54:37] Parker: my strongest evidence i’m innocent is that i voted skip to buy time for real evidence rather than blindly lynch someone
[21:54:40] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their vote to skip rather than clarify their initial silence
[21:54:40] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is their comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager,” which offered no real reasoning
[21:54:40] Adrian: i’m voting parker for evasion unless they explain why they stayed silent under questioning
[21:54:43] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:54:52] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[21:54:56] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[21:54:57] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[21:54:58] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[21:55:02] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[21:56:10] Drew: adrian, you’ve shifted your target twice now—what concrete evidence do you have this time
[21:56:12] Sidney: voting kennedy—her logical play gives her away
[21:56:17] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her methodical logic is too perfect to be mafia
[21:56:17] Tyler: sidney, you’ve defended me twice now—why are you so eager to protect me instead of pointing fingers elsewhere
[21:56:19] Adrian: why would the mafia target quiet kennedy instead of more vocal players like drew or tyler—anyone have theories
[21:56:26] Drew: hey everyone—we've just lost two bystanders, so let's focus on concrete behavior over gut feelings this round
[21:56:30] Sidney: drew’s insistence on proof feels like misdirection from his own vague claims
[21:56:34] Adrian: tyler, can you point to the exact lines where sidney defended you twice
[21:56:36] Finley: i’m suspicious of drew’s nonstop questioning—it feels like defensive misdirection
[21:56:44] Sidney: adrian’s flip-flopping suspicions without evidence seems more suspicious than tyler’s silence
[21:56:45] Drew: the mafia went after a quiet player, so i’m suspicious of loud defenders—sidney, what do you think
[21:56:54] Tyler: sidney, you’re accusing drew of vagueness—what exact claim of his do you find unsubstantiated
[21:56:55] Adrian: sidney, what specific claim of drew’s are you calling vague misdirection
[21:57:03] Finley: tyler, you’ve grilled sidney but never shared your own reasons for suspicion—what’s your theory
[21:57:08] Sidney: drew still hasn’t identified a single contradiction in my defenses despite demanding specifics
[21:57:12] Tyler: sidney’s vocal defenses and quick pivots feel more suspicious than anyone’s silence
[21:57:13] Adrian: sidney, can you cite the specific line from drew you find vague
[21:57:22] Finley: drew, you keep demanding specifics—what exact inconsistency did you see today
[21:57:25] Drew: sidney, can you point to the exact line in my questions that you consider vague
[21:57:37] Finley: sidney, deflecting back at silence without presenting drew’s vague quote just looks like misdirection
[21:57:38] Adrian: drew, can you specify what about tyler’s swift defense of sidney seems most off to you
[21:57:40] Drew: finley, sidney called parker’s skip evasive yet herself skipped explaining why she defended tyler—that’s the inconsistency
[21:57:41] Tyler: i’m suspicious of drew’s nonstop demands for proof instead of offering any accusations, so i’m leaning toward drew as mafia
[21:57:43] Sidney: drew’s call to “focus on concrete behavior over gut feelings” is undercut by his own later “i’m suspicious of loud defenders” gut claim
[21:57:49] Drew: tyler’s instant defense of sidney before any real discussion feels like teammate shielding
[21:57:57] Sidney: drew’s endless proof demands without ever naming a suspect scream misdirection to me
[21:57:59] Tyler: sidney, why have you defended me twice already yet still refuse to justify those defenses
[21:58:05] Drew: if my questions were truly evasive, tyler and sidney, please cite the exact line where i failed to back them with facts
[21:58:15] Adrian: tyler, is your snap defense of sidney honest or just misdirection
[21:58:16] Tyler: drew, you demand specifics—so who is your top suspect right now
[21:58:27] Tyler: it’s honest—no one’s provided concrete evidence against sidney
[21:58:28] Sidney: drew, you told us to “focus on concrete behavior” yet didn’t give a single example of what to watch for
[21:58:32] Finley: drew’s endless proof demands feel like clever cover for someone’s mafia play
[21:58:34] Adrian: sidney’s constant defense of tyler without offering any evidence strikes me as evasive
[21:58:37] Drew: my top suspect is sidney, her constant pivots and vague defenses strike me as evasive
[21:58:47] Sidney: drew’s endless calls for proof without naming a suspect scream misdirection
[21:58:52] Finley: adrian, you asked for proof—who are you suspicious of now and what evidence do you have
[21:58:53] Drew: i’m voting sidney for defending tyler twice without providing any evidence
[21:58:54] Adrian: drew, give us one concrete behavior to watch for instead of just demanding evidence
[21:58:55] Tyler: drew, attacking sidney on gut feelings while never providing your own evidence feels like misdirection
[21:58:56] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:59:05] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Drew
[21:59:07] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Sidney
[21:59:13] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Sidney
[21:59:20] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Drew
