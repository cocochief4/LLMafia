[21:51:54] Parker: anyone noticed suspicious behavior so far
[21:52:04] Parker: hey folks, i’ll be watching who’s too quiet or too eager with accusations
[21:52:19] Parker: i know my silence stands out, but drew’s eagerness seems fishy too
[21:52:31] Parker: tyler, why focus on silence instead of solid evidence
[21:52:40] Parker: why is sidney defending tyler so strongly
[21:53:38] Parker: kennedy, what behavior besides my silence makes you suspect me of being mafia
[21:53:59] Parker: i vote skip until someone provides concrete evidence rather than gut feelings
[21:54:19] Parker: drew’s eagerness and tyler’s instant defense of me are far more suspicious than my silence
[21:54:37] Parker: my strongest evidence i’m innocent is that i voted skip to buy time for real evidence rather than blindly lynch someone
