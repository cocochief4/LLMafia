Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too!

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

It’s important to address Tyler\'s request clearly while keeping it short. I notice that referring to Drew\'s comment as a push to target someone is useful but maybe a bit lengthy. I’ll try to lower the word count while preserving the essential message. "Drew’s ‘who’s most suspicious’ feels like an early push to frame someone" sounds more succinct. Let\'s aim for this clarity!', type='summary_text'), Summary(text='**Refining the response**\n\nI\'m focusing on how to shorten my reply about Drew\'s comment about being suspicious. I can say, "Drew\'s ‘let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now’ felt like framing tactics" or "seems like deflection," both are clear and concise at 13 words. Given Tyler’s request for specificity, I\'ll include direct quotes for clarity. I think using single quotes within double quotes will work best for clarity. This keeps it specific, relevant, and succinct for the final response.', type='summary_text')]

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

[21:51:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:51:51] Drew: hey everyone, i’m drew—anyone already feeling suspicious of someone
[21:51:51] Tyler: hey everyone, does anyone have any early hunches on who we should be keeping an eye on
[21:51:53] Adrian: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:51:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to start—any initial suspects
[21:51:54] Parker: anyone noticed suspicious behavior so far
[21:51:55] Finley: hi everyone, excited to start—anyone noticed anything odd so far
[21:51:56] Sidney: hey all, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:52:01] Tyler: hey everyone, i’m tyler—parker’s been really quiet, anyone else find that strange
[21:52:01] Adrian: hey everyone, i'm adrian, wondering why finley’s been so quiet this round
[21:52:02] Kennedy: hey everyone, parker’s awfully quiet so far—any thoughts on that
[21:52:04] Finley: i don’t have proof, but drew’s eagerness to talk makes me a bit cautious
[21:52:04] Parker: hey folks, i’ll be watching who’s too quiet or too eager with accusations
[21:52:05] Drew: hey everyone—let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now
[21:52:08] Adrian: i agree, parker’s silence definitely raises a red flag
[21:52:11] Sidney: tyler’s awfully quiet apart from asking questions—anyone else noticed
[21:52:11] Kennedy: good point—parker and finley have both been awfully quiet this round
[21:52:14] Drew: finley, what other clues made you suspicious of me besides my eagerness
[21:52:14] Finley: parker’s off-the-radar play feels fishy—any ideas why they’re so quiet
[21:52:19] Parker: i know my silence stands out, but drew’s eagerness seems fishy too
[21:52:24] Finley: jumping on parker so fast without real reasoning felt like misdirection
[21:52:24] Kennedy: finley, what specifically about drew’s eagerness feels off to you
[21:52:24] Drew: parker, can you share why you’ve been so quiet this round
[21:52:25] Sidney: tyler leading the charge against parker feels a bit suspicious—why are you so eager to accuse
[21:52:31] Parker: tyler, why focus on silence instead of solid evidence
[21:52:36] Sidney: drew still hasn’t answered finley’s question—seems defensive to me
[21:52:37] Adrian: can someone share a concrete example behind these suspicions instead of just gut feelings
[21:52:39] Tyler: sidney, which part of my comments seemed suspicious to you
[21:52:40] Parker: why is sidney defending tyler so strongly
[21:52:42] Finley: tyler’s sudden focus on parker seems like misdirection—what exactly about drew’s eagerness worries you
[21:52:48] Adrian: drew, why haven’t you answered finley’s question yet
[21:52:50] Sidney: adrian’s sudden shift from accusing finley to targeting parker feels odd—what made you change your focus
[21:52:54] Tyler: finley, can you point out the exact comment from drew that felt like misdirection
[21:53:02] Sidney: tyler, your swift defense of parker without any concrete evidence felt off to me

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[21:51:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:51:51] Drew: hey everyone, i’m drew—anyone already feeling suspicious of someone
[21:51:51] Tyler: hey everyone, does anyone have any early hunches on who we should be keeping an eye on
[21:51:53] Adrian: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:51:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to start—any initial suspects
[21:51:54] Parker: anyone noticed suspicious behavior so far
[21:51:55] Finley: hi everyone, excited to start—anyone noticed anything odd so far
[21:51:56] Sidney: hey all, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:52:01] Tyler: hey everyone, i’m tyler—parker’s been really quiet, anyone else find that strange
[21:52:01] Adrian: hey everyone, i'm adrian, wondering why finley’s been so quiet this round
[21:52:02] Kennedy: hey everyone, parker’s awfully quiet so far—any thoughts on that
[21:52:04] Finley: i don’t have proof, but drew’s eagerness to talk makes me a bit cautious
[21:52:04] Parker: hey folks, i’ll be watching who’s too quiet or too eager with accusations
[21:52:05] Drew: hey everyone—let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now
[21:52:08] Adrian: i agree, parker’s silence definitely raises a red flag
[21:52:11] Sidney: tyler’s awfully quiet apart from asking questions—anyone else noticed
[21:52:11] Kennedy: good point—parker and finley have both been awfully quiet this round
[21:52:14] Drew: finley, what other clues made you suspicious of me besides my eagerness
[21:52:14] Finley: parker’s off-the-radar play feels fishy—any ideas why they’re so quiet
[21:52:19] Parker: i know my silence stands out, but drew’s eagerness seems fishy too
[21:52:24] Finley: jumping on parker so fast without real reasoning felt like misdirection
[21:52:24] Kennedy: finley, what specifically about drew’s eagerness feels off to you
[21:52:24] Drew: parker, can you share why you’ve been so quiet this round
[21:52:25] Sidney: tyler leading the charge against parker feels a bit suspicious—why are you so eager to accuse
[21:52:31] Parker: tyler, why focus on silence instead of solid evidence
[21:52:36] Sidney: drew still hasn’t answered finley’s question—seems defensive to me
[21:52:37] Adrian: can someone share a concrete example behind these suspicions instead of just gut feelings
[21:52:39] Tyler: sidney, which part of my comments seemed suspicious to you
[21:52:40] Parker: why is sidney defending tyler so strongly
[21:52:42] Finley: tyler’s sudden focus on parker seems like misdirection—what exactly about drew’s eagerness worries you
[21:52:48] Adrian: drew, why haven’t you answered finley’s question yet
[21:52:50] Sidney: adrian’s sudden shift from accusing finley to targeting parker feels odd—what made you change your focus
[21:52:54] Tyler: finley, can you point out the exact comment from drew that felt like misdirection
[21:53:02] Sidney: tyler, your swift defense of parker without any concrete evidence felt off to me
[21:53:06] Kennedy: tyler, can you point to something parker actually said or did that seems suspicious beyond just being quiet
[21:53:08] Drew: sidney, can you point to a specific moment when i sounded defensive
[21:53:14] Tyler: adrian, could you explain why you suddenly shifted your suspicion from finley to parker
[21:53:16] Finley: drew’s “let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now” felt like misdirection
[21:53:22] Kennedy: parker, what’s your take on sidney saying tyler’s rapid defense of you looks suspicious
[21:53:23] Drew: finley, which exact line in my messages made you wary of my eagerness
[21:53:24] Tyler: parker deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of giving a clear answer
[21:53:32] Finley: adrian, what specific point made you switch your suspicion from me to parker
[21:53:37] Tyler: parker’s sole comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager” struck me as a deflection rather than helpful insight
[21:53:38] Parker: kennedy, what behavior besides my silence makes you suspect me of being mafia
[21:53:41] Kennedy: parker, can you share any concrete evidence supporting your suspicion beyond just being quiet
[21:53:41] Drew: my eagerness was just to spark discussion, finley, not to misdirect anyone
[21:53:41] Adrian: tyler, what specific action by parker prompted your immediate defense of them
[21:53:56] Drew: can we focus on specific contradictions—like adrian’s flip from finley to parker—instead of just noting who’s quiet

[21:51:54] Parker: anyone noticed suspicious behavior so far
[21:51:55] Finley: hi everyone, excited to start—anyone noticed anything odd so far
[21:51:56] Sidney: hey all, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:52:01] Tyler: hey everyone, i’m tyler—parker’s been really quiet, anyone else find that strange
[21:52:01] Adrian: hey everyone, i'm adrian, wondering why finley’s been so quiet this round
[21:52:02] Kennedy: hey everyone, parker’s awfully quiet so far—any thoughts on that
[21:52:04] Finley: i don’t have proof, but drew’s eagerness to talk makes me a bit cautious
[21:52:04] Parker: hey folks, i’ll be watching who’s too quiet or too eager with accusations
[21:52:05] Drew: hey everyone—let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now
[21:52:08] Adrian: i agree, parker’s silence definitely raises a red flag
[21:52:11] Sidney: tyler’s awfully quiet apart from asking questions—anyone else noticed
[21:52:11] Kennedy: good point—parker and finley have both been awfully quiet this round
[21:52:14] Drew: finley, what other clues made you suspicious of me besides my eagerness
[21:52:14] Finley: parker’s off-the-radar play feels fishy—any ideas why they’re so quiet
[21:52:19] Parker: i know my silence stands out, but drew’s eagerness seems fishy too
[21:52:24] Finley: jumping on parker so fast without real reasoning felt like misdirection
[21:52:24] Kennedy: finley, what specifically about drew’s eagerness feels off to you
[21:52:24] Drew: parker, can you share why you’ve been so quiet this round
[21:52:25] Sidney: tyler leading the charge against parker feels a bit suspicious—why are you so eager to accuse
[21:52:31] Parker: tyler, why focus on silence instead of solid evidence
[21:52:36] Sidney: drew still hasn’t answered finley’s question—seems defensive to me
[21:52:37] Adrian: can someone share a concrete example behind these suspicions instead of just gut feelings
[21:52:39] Tyler: sidney, which part of my comments seemed suspicious to you
[21:52:40] Parker: why is sidney defending tyler so strongly
[21:52:42] Finley: tyler’s sudden focus on parker seems like misdirection—what exactly about drew’s eagerness worries you
[21:52:48] Adrian: drew, why haven’t you answered finley’s question yet
[21:52:50] Sidney: adrian’s sudden shift from accusing finley to targeting parker feels odd—what made you change your focus
[21:52:54] Tyler: finley, can you point out the exact comment from drew that felt like misdirection
[21:53:02] Sidney: tyler, your swift defense of parker without any concrete evidence felt off to me
[21:53:06] Kennedy: tyler, can you point to something parker actually said or did that seems suspicious beyond just being quiet
[21:53:08] Drew: sidney, can you point to a specific moment when i sounded defensive
[21:53:14] Tyler: adrian, could you explain why you suddenly shifted your suspicion from finley to parker
[21:53:16] Finley: drew’s “let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now” felt like misdirection
[21:53:22] Kennedy: parker, what’s your take on sidney saying tyler’s rapid defense of you looks suspicious
[21:53:23] Drew: finley, which exact line in my messages made you wary of my eagerness
[21:53:24] Tyler: parker deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of giving a clear answer
[21:53:32] Finley: adrian, what specific point made you switch your suspicion from me to parker
[21:53:37] Tyler: parker’s sole comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager” struck me as a deflection rather than helpful insight
[21:53:38] Parker: kennedy, what behavior besides my silence makes you suspect me of being mafia
[21:53:41] Kennedy: parker, can you share any concrete evidence supporting your suspicion beyond just being quiet
[21:53:41] Drew: my eagerness was just to spark discussion, finley, not to misdirect anyone
[21:53:41] Adrian: tyler, what specific action by parker prompted your immediate defense of them
[21:53:56] Drew: can we focus on specific contradictions—like adrian’s flip from finley to parker—instead of just noting who’s quiet
[21:53:58] Kennedy: by deflecting questions rather than addressing your own quiet start, you’re coming across as evasive
[21:53:59] Parker: i vote skip until someone provides concrete evidence rather than gut feelings
[21:54:00] Adrian: with two minutes left, can each of us name our single strongest piece of evidence for or against parker so we can move to a vote
[21:54:01] Sidney: drew, what makes parker’s silence more suspicious than finley’s or tyler’s chatter
Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

Do you want to send a message to the group chat now, or do you prefer to wait for now and see what messages others will send? Remember to choose to send a message only if your contribution to the discussion in the current time will be meaningful enough. Don't overflow the discussion with your messages! Pay attention to the amount of messages with your name compared to the amount of messages with names of other players and let them have their turn too! Check the speaker name in the last few messages, and decide accordingly based on whether you talked too much. Reply only with `<send>` if you want to send a message now, or only with `<wait>` if you want to wait for now, based on your decision!

## CONTENT: [Summary(text="**Deciding Finley's Next Move**\n\nI'm considering whether Finley should speak at this moment, around 21:54:22, just after Parker's suspicious comments about others. With four players giving strong evidence against Parker, it's clear that tensions are high. Finley wants to be involved but not too obvious, aiming for meaningful contributions. With 1:38 left, proposing a vote or suggesting next steps seems wise. Finley’s personality is outgoing, yet prefers not to dominate the conversation. I think it’s a pivotal moment.", type='summary_text')]

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[21:51:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:51:51] Drew: hey everyone, i’m drew—anyone already feeling suspicious of someone
[21:51:51] Tyler: hey everyone, does anyone have any early hunches on who we should be keeping an eye on
[21:51:53] Adrian: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:51:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to start—any initial suspects
[21:51:54] Parker: anyone noticed suspicious behavior so far
[21:51:55] Finley: hi everyone, excited to start—anyone noticed anything odd so far
[21:51:56] Sidney: hey all, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:52:01] Tyler: hey everyone, i’m tyler—parker’s been really quiet, anyone else find that strange
[21:52:01] Adrian: hey everyone, i'm adrian, wondering why finley’s been so quiet this round
[21:52:02] Kennedy: hey everyone, parker’s awfully quiet so far—any thoughts on that
[21:52:04] Finley: i don’t have proof, but drew’s eagerness to talk makes me a bit cautious
[21:52:04] Parker: hey folks, i’ll be watching who’s too quiet or too eager with accusations
[21:52:05] Drew: hey everyone—let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now
[21:52:08] Adrian: i agree, parker’s silence definitely raises a red flag
[21:52:11] Sidney: tyler’s awfully quiet apart from asking questions—anyone else noticed
[21:52:11] Kennedy: good point—parker and finley have both been awfully quiet this round
[21:52:14] Drew: finley, what other clues made you suspicious of me besides my eagerness
[21:52:14] Finley: parker’s off-the-radar play feels fishy—any ideas why they’re so quiet
[21:52:19] Parker: i know my silence stands out, but drew’s eagerness seems fishy too
[21:52:24] Finley: jumping on parker so fast without real reasoning felt like misdirection
[21:52:24] Kennedy: finley, what specifically about drew’s eagerness feels off to you
[21:52:24] Drew: parker, can you share why you’ve been so quiet this round
[21:52:25] Sidney: tyler leading the charge against parker feels a bit suspicious—why are you so eager to accuse
[21:52:31] Parker: tyler, why focus on silence instead of solid evidence
[21:52:36] Sidney: drew still hasn’t answered finley’s question—seems defensive to me
[21:52:37] Adrian: can someone share a concrete example behind these suspicions instead of just gut feelings
[21:52:39] Tyler: sidney, which part of my comments seemed suspicious to you
[21:52:40] Parker: why is sidney defending tyler so strongly
[21:52:42] Finley: tyler’s sudden focus on parker seems like misdirection—what exactly about drew’s eagerness worries you
[21:52:48] Adrian: drew, why haven’t you answered finley’s question yet
[21:52:50] Sidney: adrian’s sudden shift from accusing finley to targeting parker feels odd—what made you change your focus
[21:52:54] Tyler: finley, can you point out the exact comment from drew that felt like misdirection
[21:53:02] Sidney: tyler, your swift defense of parker without any concrete evidence felt off to me
[21:53:06] Kennedy: tyler, can you point to something parker actually said or did that seems suspicious beyond just being quiet
[21:53:08] Drew: sidney, can you point to a specific moment when i sounded defensive
[21:53:14] Tyler: adrian, could you explain why you suddenly shifted your suspicion from finley to parker
[21:53:16] Finley: drew’s “let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now” felt like misdirection
[21:53:22] Kennedy: parker, what’s your take on sidney saying tyler’s rapid defense of you looks suspicious
[21:53:23] Drew: finley, which exact line in my messages made you wary of my eagerness
[21:53:24] Tyler: parker deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of giving a clear answer
[21:53:32] Finley: adrian, what specific point made you switch your suspicion from me to parker
[21:53:37] Tyler: parker’s sole comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager” struck me as a deflection rather than helpful insight
[21:53:38] Parker: kennedy, what behavior besides my silence makes you suspect me of being mafia
[21:53:41] Kennedy: parker, can you share any concrete evidence supporting your suspicion beyond just being quiet
[21:53:41] Drew: my eagerness was just to spark discussion, finley, not to misdirect anyone
[21:53:41] Adrian: tyler, what specific action by parker prompted your immediate defense of them
[21:53:56] Drew: can we focus on specific contradictions—like adrian’s flip from finley to parker—instead of just noting who’s quiet
[21:53:58] Kennedy: by deflecting questions rather than addressing your own quiet start, you’re coming across as evasive
[21:53:59] Parker: i vote skip until someone provides concrete evidence rather than gut feelings
[21:54:00] Adrian: with two minutes left, can each of us name our single strongest piece of evidence for or against parker so we can move to a vote
[21:54:01] Sidney: drew, what makes parker’s silence more suspicious than finley’s or tyler’s chatter
[21:54:10] Tyler: i defended parker because they deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of answering it
[21:54:11] Sidney: my strongest evidence against parker is their refusal to explain their initial silence under questioning
[21:54:13] Adrian: sidney, can you point to the exact phrase in tyler’s defense of parker that felt off to you
[21:54:15] Finley: parker hasn’t provided any concrete examples beyond calling people “quiet” or “eager,” which feels evasive
[21:54:16] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their insta-skip vote when everyone asked for specifics, which feels like evasion rather than explanation
[21:54:18] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is they keep equating silence with guilt without ever providing a concrete example of suspicious behavior
[21:54:19] Parker: drew’s eagerness and tyler’s instant defense of me are far more suspicious than my silence
Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.
Don't add the time, the timestamp or the [timestamp] in your answer!

[21:52:11] Kennedy: good point—parker and finley have both been awfully quiet this round
[21:52:14] Drew: finley, what other clues made you suspicious of me besides my eagerness
[21:52:14] Finley: parker’s off-the-radar play feels fishy—any ideas why they’re so quiet
[21:52:19] Parker: i know my silence stands out, but drew’s eagerness seems fishy too
[21:52:24] Finley: jumping on parker so fast without real reasoning felt like misdirection
[21:52:24] Kennedy: finley, what specifically about drew’s eagerness feels off to you
[21:52:24] Drew: parker, can you share why you’ve been so quiet this round
[21:52:25] Sidney: tyler leading the charge against parker feels a bit suspicious—why are you so eager to accuse
[21:52:31] Parker: tyler, why focus on silence instead of solid evidence
[21:52:36] Sidney: drew still hasn’t answered finley’s question—seems defensive to me
[21:52:37] Adrian: can someone share a concrete example behind these suspicions instead of just gut feelings
[21:52:39] Tyler: sidney, which part of my comments seemed suspicious to you
[21:52:40] Parker: why is sidney defending tyler so strongly
[21:52:42] Finley: tyler’s sudden focus on parker seems like misdirection—what exactly about drew’s eagerness worries you
[21:52:48] Adrian: drew, why haven’t you answered finley’s question yet
[21:52:50] Sidney: adrian’s sudden shift from accusing finley to targeting parker feels odd—what made you change your focus
[21:52:54] Tyler: finley, can you point out the exact comment from drew that felt like misdirection
[21:53:02] Sidney: tyler, your swift defense of parker without any concrete evidence felt off to me
[21:53:06] Kennedy: tyler, can you point to something parker actually said or did that seems suspicious beyond just being quiet
[21:53:08] Drew: sidney, can you point to a specific moment when i sounded defensive
[21:53:14] Tyler: adrian, could you explain why you suddenly shifted your suspicion from finley to parker
[21:53:16] Finley: drew’s “let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now” felt like misdirection
[21:53:22] Kennedy: parker, what’s your take on sidney saying tyler’s rapid defense of you looks suspicious
[21:53:23] Drew: finley, which exact line in my messages made you wary of my eagerness
[21:53:24] Tyler: parker deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of giving a clear answer
[21:53:32] Finley: adrian, what specific point made you switch your suspicion from me to parker
[21:53:37] Tyler: parker’s sole comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager” struck me as a deflection rather than helpful insight
[21:53:38] Parker: kennedy, what behavior besides my silence makes you suspect me of being mafia
[21:53:41] Kennedy: parker, can you share any concrete evidence supporting your suspicion beyond just being quiet
[21:53:41] Drew: my eagerness was just to spark discussion, finley, not to misdirect anyone
[21:53:41] Adrian: tyler, what specific action by parker prompted your immediate defense of them
[21:53:56] Drew: can we focus on specific contradictions—like adrian’s flip from finley to parker—instead of just noting who’s quiet
[21:53:58] Kennedy: by deflecting questions rather than addressing your own quiet start, you’re coming across as evasive
[21:53:59] Parker: i vote skip until someone provides concrete evidence rather than gut feelings
[21:54:00] Adrian: with two minutes left, can each of us name our single strongest piece of evidence for or against parker so we can move to a vote
[21:54:01] Sidney: drew, what makes parker’s silence more suspicious than finley’s or tyler’s chatter
[21:54:10] Tyler: i defended parker because they deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of answering it
[21:54:11] Sidney: my strongest evidence against parker is their refusal to explain their initial silence under questioning
[21:54:13] Adrian: sidney, can you point to the exact phrase in tyler’s defense of parker that felt off to you
[21:54:15] Finley: parker hasn’t provided any concrete examples beyond calling people “quiet” or “eager,” which feels evasive
[21:54:16] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their insta-skip vote when everyone asked for specifics, which feels like evasion rather than explanation
[21:54:18] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is they keep equating silence with guilt without ever providing a concrete example of suspicious behavior
[21:54:19] Parker: drew’s eagerness and tyler’s instant defense of me are far more suspicious than my silence
[21:54:23] Tyler: my strongest evidence against parker is their total refusal to address any direct question, only pushing to skip without justification
[21:54:24] Sidney: my strongest evidence is parker voting skip rather than explaining why they were silent when directly questioned
[21:54:29] Adrian: my strongest evidence against parker is their deflection when asked why they abruptly switched suspicion from finley to parker

[21:51:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:51:51] Drew: hey everyone, i’m drew—anyone already feeling suspicious of someone

[21:52:02] Kennedy: hey everyone, parker’s awfully quiet so far—any thoughts on that
[21:52:04] Finley: i don’t have proof, but drew’s eagerness to talk makes me a bit cautious
[21:52:04] Parker: hey folks, i’ll be watching who’s too quiet or too eager with accusations
[21:52:05] Drew: hey everyone—let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now
[21:52:08] Adrian: i agree, parker’s silence definitely raises a red flag

[21:54:37] Parker: my strongest evidence i’m innocent is that i voted skip to buy time for real evidence rather than blindly lynch someone

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [21:51:43].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)

[21:54:19] Parker: drew’s eagerness and tyler’s instant defense of me are far more suspicious than my silence
[21:54:23] Tyler: my strongest evidence against parker is their total refusal to address any direct question, only pushing to skip without justification
[21:54:24] Sidney: my strongest evidence is parker voting skip rather than explaining why they were silent when directly questioned
[21:54:29] Adrian: my strongest evidence against parker is their deflection when asked why they abruptly switched suspicion from finley to parker
[21:54:35] Finley: parker, your shift to blaming others without clarifying your own silence again feels like misdirection
[21:54:36] Tyler: unless parker explains their skip vote, i’ll be voting them out
[21:54:37] Parker: my strongest evidence i’m innocent is that i voted skip to buy time for real evidence rather than blindly lynch someone
[21:54:40] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their vote to skip rather than clarify their initial silence
[21:54:40] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is their comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager,” which offered no real reasoning
[21:54:40] Adrian: i’m voting parker for evasion unless they explain why they stayed silent under questioning
[21:54:43] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[21:51:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:51:51] Drew: hey everyone, i’m drew—anyone already feeling suspicious of someone
[21:51:51] Tyler: hey everyone, does anyone have any early hunches on who we should be keeping an eye on
[21:51:53] Adrian: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:51:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to start—any initial suspects
[21:51:54] Parker: anyone noticed suspicious behavior so far
[21:51:55] Finley: hi everyone, excited to start—anyone noticed anything odd so far
[21:51:56] Sidney: hey all, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:52:01] Tyler: hey everyone, i’m tyler—parker’s been really quiet, anyone else find that strange
[21:52:01] Adrian: hey everyone, i'm adrian, wondering why finley’s been so quiet this round
[21:52:02] Kennedy: hey everyone, parker’s awfully quiet so far—any thoughts on that
[21:52:04] Finley: i don’t have proof, but drew’s eagerness to talk makes me a bit cautious
[21:52:04] Parker: hey folks, i’ll be watching who’s too quiet or too eager with accusations
[21:52:05] Drew: hey everyone—let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now
[21:52:08] Adrian: i agree, parker’s silence definitely raises a red flag
[21:52:11] Sidney: tyler’s awfully quiet apart from asking questions—anyone else noticed
[21:52:11] Kennedy: good point—parker and finley have both been awfully quiet this round
[21:52:14] Drew: finley, what other clues made you suspicious of me besides my eagerness
[21:52:14] Finley: parker’s off-the-radar play feels fishy—any ideas why they’re so quiet
[21:52:19] Parker: i know my silence stands out, but drew’s eagerness seems fishy too
[21:52:24] Finley: jumping on parker so fast without real reasoning felt like misdirection
[21:52:24] Kennedy: finley, what specifically about drew’s eagerness feels off to you
[21:52:24] Drew: parker, can you share why you’ve been so quiet this round
[21:52:25] Sidney: tyler leading the charge against parker feels a bit suspicious—why are you so eager to accuse
[21:52:31] Parker: tyler, why focus on silence instead of solid evidence
[21:52:36] Sidney: drew still hasn’t answered finley’s question—seems defensive to me
[21:52:37] Adrian: can someone share a concrete example behind these suspicions instead of just gut feelings
[21:52:39] Tyler: sidney, which part of my comments seemed suspicious to you
[21:52:40] Parker: why is sidney defending tyler so strongly
[21:52:42] Finley: tyler’s sudden focus on parker seems like misdirection—what exactly about drew’s eagerness worries you
[21:52:48] Adrian: drew, why haven’t you answered finley’s question yet
[21:52:50] Sidney: adrian’s sudden shift from accusing finley to targeting parker feels odd—what made you change your focus
[21:52:54] Tyler: finley, can you point out the exact comment from drew that felt like misdirection
[21:53:02] Sidney: tyler, your swift defense of parker without any concrete evidence felt off to me
[21:53:06] Kennedy: tyler, can you point to something parker actually said or did that seems suspicious beyond just being quiet
[21:53:08] Drew: sidney, can you point to a specific moment when i sounded defensive
[21:53:14] Tyler: adrian, could you explain why you suddenly shifted your suspicion from finley to parker
[21:53:16] Finley: drew’s “let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now” felt like misdirection
[21:53:22] Kennedy: parker, what’s your take on sidney saying tyler’s rapid defense of you looks suspicious
[21:53:23] Drew: finley, which exact line in my messages made you wary of my eagerness
[21:53:24] Tyler: parker deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of giving a clear answer
[21:53:32] Finley: adrian, what specific point made you switch your suspicion from me to parker
[21:53:37] Tyler: parker’s sole comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager” struck me as a deflection rather than helpful insight
[21:53:38] Parker: kennedy, what behavior besides my silence makes you suspect me of being mafia
[21:53:41] Kennedy: parker, can you share any concrete evidence supporting your suspicion beyond just being quiet
[21:53:41] Drew: my eagerness was just to spark discussion, finley, not to misdirect anyone
[21:53:41] Adrian: tyler, what specific action by parker prompted your immediate defense of them
[21:53:56] Drew: can we focus on specific contradictions—like adrian’s flip from finley to parker—instead of just noting who’s quiet
[21:53:58] Kennedy: by deflecting questions rather than addressing your own quiet start, you’re coming across as evasive
[21:53:59] Parker: i vote skip until someone provides concrete evidence rather than gut feelings
[21:54:00] Adrian: with two minutes left, can each of us name our single strongest piece of evidence for or against parker so we can move to a vote
[21:54:01] Sidney: drew, what makes parker’s silence more suspicious than finley’s or tyler’s chatter
[21:54:10] Tyler: i defended parker because they deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of answering it
[21:54:11] Sidney: my strongest evidence against parker is their refusal to explain their initial silence under questioning
[21:54:13] Adrian: sidney, can you point to the exact phrase in tyler’s defense of parker that felt off to you
[21:54:15] Finley: parker hasn’t provided any concrete examples beyond calling people “quiet” or “eager,” which feels evasive

[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[21:51:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:51:51] Drew: hey everyone, i’m drew—anyone already feeling suspicious of someone
[21:51:51] Tyler: hey everyone, does anyone have any early hunches on who we should be keeping an eye on
[21:51:53] Adrian: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:51:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to start—any initial suspects
[21:51:54] Parker: anyone noticed suspicious behavior so far
[21:51:55] Finley: hi everyone, excited to start—anyone noticed anything odd so far
[21:51:56] Sidney: hey all, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:52:01] Tyler: hey everyone, i’m tyler—parker’s been really quiet, anyone else find that strange
[21:52:01] Adrian: hey everyone, i'm adrian, wondering why finley’s been so quiet this round
[21:52:02] Kennedy: hey everyone, parker’s awfully quiet so far—any thoughts on that
[21:52:04] Finley: i don’t have proof, but drew’s eagerness to talk makes me a bit cautious
[21:52:04] Parker: hey folks, i’ll be watching who’s too quiet or too eager with accusations
[21:52:05] Drew: hey everyone—let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now
[21:52:08] Adrian: i agree, parker’s silence definitely raises a red flag
[21:52:11] Sidney: tyler’s awfully quiet apart from asking questions—anyone else noticed
[21:52:11] Kennedy: good point—parker and finley have both been awfully quiet this round
[21:52:14] Drew: finley, what other clues made you suspicious of me besides my eagerness
[21:52:14] Finley: parker’s off-the-radar play feels fishy—any ideas why they’re so quiet
[21:52:19] Parker: i know my silence stands out, but drew’s eagerness seems fishy too
[21:52:24] Finley: jumping on parker so fast without real reasoning felt like misdirection
[21:52:24] Kennedy: finley, what specifically about drew’s eagerness feels off to you
[21:52:24] Drew: parker, can you share why you’ve been so quiet this round
[21:52:25] Sidney: tyler leading the charge against parker feels a bit suspicious—why are you so eager to accuse
[21:52:31] Parker: tyler, why focus on silence instead of solid evidence
[21:52:36] Sidney: drew still hasn’t answered finley’s question—seems defensive to me
[21:52:37] Adrian: can someone share a concrete example behind these suspicions instead of just gut feelings
[21:52:39] Tyler: sidney, which part of my comments seemed suspicious to you
[21:52:40] Parker: why is sidney defending tyler so strongly
[21:52:42] Finley: tyler’s sudden focus on parker seems like misdirection—what exactly about drew’s eagerness worries you
[21:52:48] Adrian: drew, why haven’t you answered finley’s question yet
[21:52:50] Sidney: adrian’s sudden shift from accusing finley to targeting parker feels odd—what made you change your focus
[21:52:54] Tyler: finley, can you point out the exact comment from drew that felt like misdirection
[21:53:02] Sidney: tyler, your swift defense of parker without any concrete evidence felt off to me
[21:53:06] Kennedy: tyler, can you point to something parker actually said or did that seems suspicious beyond just being quiet
[21:53:08] Drew: sidney, can you point to a specific moment when i sounded defensive
[21:53:14] Tyler: adrian, could you explain why you suddenly shifted your suspicion from finley to parker
[21:53:16] Finley: drew’s “let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now” felt like misdirection
[21:53:22] Kennedy: parker, what’s your take on sidney saying tyler’s rapid defense of you looks suspicious
[21:53:23] Drew: finley, which exact line in my messages made you wary of my eagerness
[21:53:24] Tyler: parker deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of giving a clear answer
[21:53:32] Finley: adrian, what specific point made you switch your suspicion from me to parker
[21:53:37] Tyler: parker’s sole comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager” struck me as a deflection rather than helpful insight
[21:53:38] Parker: kennedy, what behavior besides my silence makes you suspect me of being mafia
[21:53:41] Kennedy: parker, can you share any concrete evidence supporting your suspicion beyond just being quiet
[21:53:41] Drew: my eagerness was just to spark discussion, finley, not to misdirect anyone
[21:53:41] Adrian: tyler, what specific action by parker prompted your immediate defense of them
[21:53:56] Drew: can we focus on specific contradictions—like adrian’s flip from finley to parker—instead of just noting who’s quiet
[21:53:58] Kennedy: by deflecting questions rather than addressing your own quiet start, you’re coming across as evasive
[21:53:59] Parker: i vote skip until someone provides concrete evidence rather than gut feelings
[21:54:00] Adrian: with two minutes left, can each of us name our single strongest piece of evidence for or against parker so we can move to a vote
[21:54:01] Sidney: drew, what makes parker’s silence more suspicious than finley’s or tyler’s chatter
[21:54:10] Tyler: i defended parker because they deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of answering it
[21:54:11] Sidney: my strongest evidence against parker is their refusal to explain their initial silence under questioning
[21:54:13] Adrian: sidney, can you point to the exact phrase in tyler’s defense of parker that felt off to you
[21:54:15] Finley: parker hasn’t provided any concrete examples beyond calling people “quiet” or “eager,” which feels evasive
[21:54:16] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their insta-skip vote when everyone asked for specifics, which feels like evasion rather than explanation
[21:54:18] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is they keep equating silence with guilt without ever providing a concrete example of suspicious behavior
[21:54:19] Parker: drew’s eagerness and tyler’s instant defense of me are far more suspicious than my silence
[21:54:23] Tyler: my strongest evidence against parker is their total refusal to address any direct question, only pushing to skip without justification
[21:54:24] Sidney: my strongest evidence is parker voting skip rather than explaining why they were silent when directly questioned
[21:54:29] Adrian: my strongest evidence against parker is their deflection when asked why they abruptly switched suspicion from finley to parker
[21:54:35] Finley: parker, your shift to blaming others without clarifying your own silence again feels like misdirection
[21:54:36] Tyler: unless parker explains their skip vote, i’ll be voting them out
[21:54:37] Parker: my strongest evidence i’m innocent is that i voted skip to buy time for real evidence rather than blindly lynch someone
[21:54:40] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their vote to skip rather than clarify their initial silence
[21:54:40] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is their comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager,” which offered no real reasoning
[21:54:40] Adrian: i’m voting parker for evasion unless they explain why they stayed silent under questioning
[21:54:43] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:54:52] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[21:54:56] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[21:54:57] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[21:54:58] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew

Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself! Match your style of message to the other player's message style, with more emphasis on more recent messages.

[21:51:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:51:51] Drew: hey everyone, i’m drew—anyone already feeling suspicious of someone
[21:51:51] Tyler: hey everyone, does anyone have any early hunches on who we should be keeping an eye on
[21:51:53] Adrian: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:51:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to start—any initial suspects
[21:51:54] Parker: anyone noticed suspicious behavior so far
[21:51:55] Finley: hi everyone, excited to start—anyone noticed anything odd so far
[21:51:56] Sidney: hey all, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:52:01] Tyler: hey everyone, i’m tyler—parker’s been really quiet, anyone else find that strange
[21:52:01] Adrian: hey everyone, i'm adrian, wondering why finley’s been so quiet this round
[21:52:02] Kennedy: hey everyone, parker’s awfully quiet so far—any thoughts on that
[21:52:04] Finley: i don’t have proof, but drew’s eagerness to talk makes me a bit cautious
[21:52:04] Parker: hey folks, i’ll be watching who’s too quiet or too eager with accusations
[21:52:05] Drew: hey everyone—let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now
[21:52:08] Adrian: i agree, parker’s silence definitely raises a red flag
[21:52:11] Sidney: tyler’s awfully quiet apart from asking questions—anyone else noticed
[21:52:11] Kennedy: good point—parker and finley have both been awfully quiet this round
[21:52:14] Drew: finley, what other clues made you suspicious of me besides my eagerness
[21:52:14] Finley: parker’s off-the-radar play feels fishy—any ideas why they’re so quiet
[21:52:19] Parker: i know my silence stands out, but drew’s eagerness seems fishy too
[21:52:24] Finley: jumping on parker so fast without real reasoning felt like misdirection
[21:52:24] Kennedy: finley, what specifically about drew’s eagerness feels off to you
[21:52:24] Drew: parker, can you share why you’ve been so quiet this round
[21:52:25] Sidney: tyler leading the charge against parker feels a bit suspicious—why are you so eager to accuse
[21:52:31] Parker: tyler, why focus on silence instead of solid evidence
[21:52:36] Sidney: drew still hasn’t answered finley’s question—seems defensive to me
[21:52:37] Adrian: can someone share a concrete example behind these suspicions instead of just gut feelings
[21:52:39] Tyler: sidney, which part of my comments seemed suspicious to you
[21:52:40] Parker: why is sidney defending tyler so strongly
[21:52:42] Finley: tyler’s sudden focus on parker seems like misdirection—what exactly about drew’s eagerness worries you
[21:52:48] Adrian: drew, why haven’t you answered finley’s question yet
[21:52:50] Sidney: adrian’s sudden shift from accusing finley to targeting parker feels odd—what made you change your focus
[21:52:54] Tyler: finley, can you point out the exact comment from drew that felt like misdirection
[21:53:02] Sidney: tyler, your swift defense of parker without any concrete evidence felt off to me
[21:53:06] Kennedy: tyler, can you point to something parker actually said or did that seems suspicious beyond just being quiet
[21:53:08] Drew: sidney, can you point to a specific moment when i sounded defensive
[21:53:14] Tyler: adrian, could you explain why you suddenly shifted your suspicion from finley to parker
[21:53:16] Finley: drew’s “let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now” felt like misdirection
[21:53:22] Kennedy: parker, what’s your take on sidney saying tyler’s rapid defense of you looks suspicious
[21:53:23] Drew: finley, which exact line in my messages made you wary of my eagerness
[21:53:24] Tyler: parker deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of giving a clear answer
[21:53:32] Finley: adrian, what specific point made you switch your suspicion from me to parker
[21:53:37] Tyler: parker’s sole comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager” struck me as a deflection rather than helpful insight
[21:53:38] Parker: kennedy, what behavior besides my silence makes you suspect me of being mafia
[21:53:41] Kennedy: parker, can you share any concrete evidence supporting your suspicion beyond just being quiet
[21:53:41] Drew: my eagerness was just to spark discussion, finley, not to misdirect anyone
[21:53:41] Adrian: tyler, what specific action by parker prompted your immediate defense of them
[21:53:56] Drew: can we focus on specific contradictions—like adrian’s flip from finley to parker—instead of just noting who’s quiet
[21:53:58] Kennedy: by deflecting questions rather than addressing your own quiet start, you’re coming across as evasive
[21:53:59] Parker: i vote skip until someone provides concrete evidence rather than gut feelings
[21:54:00] Adrian: with two minutes left, can each of us name our single strongest piece of evidence for or against parker so we can move to a vote
[21:54:01] Sidney: drew, what makes parker’s silence more suspicious than finley’s or tyler’s chatter
[21:54:10] Tyler: i defended parker because they deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of answering it
[21:54:11] Sidney: my strongest evidence against parker is their refusal to explain their initial silence under questioning
[21:54:13] Adrian: sidney, can you point to the exact phrase in tyler’s defense of parker that felt off to you
[21:54:15] Finley: parker hasn’t provided any concrete examples beyond calling people “quiet” or “eager,” which feels evasive
[21:54:16] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their insta-skip vote when everyone asked for specifics, which feels like evasion rather than explanation
[21:54:18] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is they keep equating silence with guilt without ever providing a concrete example of suspicious behavior
[21:54:19] Parker: drew’s eagerness and tyler’s instant defense of me are far more suspicious than my silence
[21:54:23] Tyler: my strongest evidence against parker is their total refusal to address any direct question, only pushing to skip without justification
[21:54:24] Sidney: my strongest evidence is parker voting skip rather than explaining why they were silent when directly questioned
[21:54:29] Adrian: my strongest evidence against parker is their deflection when asked why they abruptly switched suspicion from finley to parker
[21:54:35] Finley: parker, your shift to blaming others without clarifying your own silence again feels like misdirection
[21:54:36] Tyler: unless parker explains their skip vote, i’ll be voting them out
[21:54:37] Parker: my strongest evidence i’m innocent is that i voted skip to buy time for real evidence rather than blindly lynch someone
[21:54:40] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their vote to skip rather than clarify their initial silence
[21:54:40] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is their comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager,” which offered no real reasoning
[21:54:40] Adrian: i’m voting parker for evasion unless they explain why they stayed silent under questioning
[21:54:43] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:54:52] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[21:54:56] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[21:54:57] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[21:54:58] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[21:55:02] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[21:55:22] Finley: let’s eliminate kennedy tonight
[21:55:23] Sidney: let’s target drew tonight—his nonstop chatter could expose us tomorrow
[21:55:32] Sidney: agree, targeting kennedy makes sense since their logical play screams bystander
[21:55:35] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [21:51:43].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:

 Sidney (mafia)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (mafia)
 Kennedy (bystander)

[21:51:51] Tyler: hey everyone, does anyone have any early hunches on who we should be keeping an eye on
[21:51:53] Adrian: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:51:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to start—any initial suspects
[21:51:54] Parker: anyone noticed suspicious behavior so far
[21:51:55] Finley: hi everyone, excited to start—anyone noticed anything odd so far
[21:51:56] Sidney: hey all, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:52:01] Tyler: hey everyone, i’m tyler—parker’s been really quiet, anyone else find that strange
[21:52:01] Adrian: hey everyone, i'm adrian, wondering why finley’s been so quiet this round
[21:52:02] Kennedy: hey everyone, parker’s awfully quiet so far—any thoughts on that
[21:52:04] Finley: i don’t have proof, but drew’s eagerness to talk makes me a bit cautious
[21:52:04] Parker: hey folks, i’ll be watching who’s too quiet or too eager with accusations
[21:52:05] Drew: hey everyone—let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now
[21:52:08] Adrian: i agree, parker’s silence definitely raises a red flag
[21:52:11] Sidney: tyler’s awfully quiet apart from asking questions—anyone else noticed
[21:52:11] Kennedy: good point—parker and finley have both been awfully quiet this round
[21:52:14] Drew: finley, what other clues made you suspicious of me besides my eagerness
[21:52:14] Finley: parker’s off-the-radar play feels fishy—any ideas why they’re so quiet
[21:52:19] Parker: i know my silence stands out, but drew’s eagerness seems fishy too
[21:52:24] Finley: jumping on parker so fast without real reasoning felt like misdirection
[21:52:24] Kennedy: finley, what specifically about drew’s eagerness feels off to you
[21:52:24] Drew: parker, can you share why you’ve been so quiet this round
[21:52:25] Sidney: tyler leading the charge against parker feels a bit suspicious—why are you so eager to accuse
[21:52:31] Parker: tyler, why focus on silence instead of solid evidence
[21:52:36] Sidney: drew still hasn’t answered finley’s question—seems defensive to me
[21:52:37] Adrian: can someone share a concrete example behind these suspicions instead of just gut feelings
[21:52:39] Tyler: sidney, which part of my comments seemed suspicious to you
[21:52:40] Parker: why is sidney defending tyler so strongly
[21:52:42] Finley: tyler’s sudden focus on parker seems like misdirection—what exactly about drew’s eagerness worries you
[21:52:48] Adrian: drew, why haven’t you answered finley’s question yet
[21:52:50] Sidney: adrian’s sudden shift from accusing finley to targeting parker feels odd—what made you change your focus
[21:52:54] Tyler: finley, can you point out the exact comment from drew that felt like misdirection
[21:53:02] Sidney: tyler, your swift defense of parker without any concrete evidence felt off to me
[21:53:06] Kennedy: tyler, can you point to something parker actually said or did that seems suspicious beyond just being quiet
[21:53:08] Drew: sidney, can you point to a specific moment when i sounded defensive
[21:53:14] Tyler: adrian, could you explain why you suddenly shifted your suspicion from finley to parker
[21:53:16] Finley: drew’s “let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now” felt like misdirection
[21:53:22] Kennedy: parker, what’s your take on sidney saying tyler’s rapid defense of you looks suspicious
[21:53:23] Drew: finley, which exact line in my messages made you wary of my eagerness
[21:53:24] Tyler: parker deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of giving a clear answer
[21:53:32] Finley: adrian, what specific point made you switch your suspicion from me to parker
[21:53:37] Tyler: parker’s sole comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager” struck me as a deflection rather than helpful insight
[21:53:38] Parker: kennedy, what behavior besides my silence makes you suspect me of being mafia
[21:53:41] Kennedy: parker, can you share any concrete evidence supporting your suspicion beyond just being quiet
[21:53:41] Drew: my eagerness was just to spark discussion, finley, not to misdirect anyone
[21:53:41] Adrian: tyler, what specific action by parker prompted your immediate defense of them
[21:53:56] Drew: can we focus on specific contradictions—like adrian’s flip from finley to parker—instead of just noting who’s quiet
[21:53:58] Kennedy: by deflecting questions rather than addressing your own quiet start, you’re coming across as evasive
[21:53:59] Parker: i vote skip until someone provides concrete evidence rather than gut feelings
[21:54:00] Adrian: with two minutes left, can each of us name our single strongest piece of evidence for or against parker so we can move to a vote
[21:54:01] Sidney: drew, what makes parker’s silence more suspicious than finley’s or tyler’s chatter
[21:54:10] Tyler: i defended parker because they deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of answering it
[21:54:11] Sidney: my strongest evidence against parker is their refusal to explain their initial silence under questioning
[21:54:13] Adrian: sidney, can you point to the exact phrase in tyler’s defense of parker that felt off to you
[21:54:15] Finley: parker hasn’t provided any concrete examples beyond calling people “quiet” or “eager,” which feels evasive
[21:54:16] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their insta-skip vote when everyone asked for specifics, which feels like evasion rather than explanation
[21:54:18] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is they keep equating silence with guilt without ever providing a concrete example of suspicious behavior
[21:54:19] Parker: drew’s eagerness and tyler’s instant defense of me are far more suspicious than my silence
[21:54:23] Tyler: my strongest evidence against parker is their total refusal to address any direct question, only pushing to skip without justification
[21:54:24] Sidney: my strongest evidence is parker voting skip rather than explaining why they were silent when directly questioned
[21:54:29] Adrian: my strongest evidence against parker is their deflection when asked why they abruptly switched suspicion from finley to parker
[21:54:35] Finley: parker, your shift to blaming others without clarifying your own silence again feels like misdirection
[21:54:36] Tyler: unless parker explains their skip vote, i’ll be voting them out
[21:54:37] Parker: my strongest evidence i’m innocent is that i voted skip to buy time for real evidence rather than blindly lynch someone
[21:54:40] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their vote to skip rather than clarify their initial silence
[21:54:40] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is their comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager,” which offered no real reasoning
[21:54:40] Adrian: i’m voting parker for evasion unless they explain why they stayed silent under questioning
[21:54:43] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:54:52] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[21:54:56] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[21:54:57] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[21:54:58] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[21:55:02] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[21:55:22] Finley: let’s eliminate kennedy tonight
[21:55:23] Sidney: let’s target drew tonight—his nonstop chatter could expose us tomorrow
[21:55:32] Sidney: agree, targeting kennedy makes sense since their logical play screams bystander
[21:55:35] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[21:51:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:51:51] Drew: hey everyone, i’m drew—anyone already feeling suspicious of someone
[21:51:51] Tyler: hey everyone, does anyone have any early hunches on who we should be keeping an eye on
[21:51:53] Adrian: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:51:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to start—any initial suspects
[21:51:54] Parker: anyone noticed suspicious behavior so far
[21:51:55] Finley: hi everyone, excited to start—anyone noticed anything odd so far
[21:51:56] Sidney: hey all, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:52:01] Tyler: hey everyone, i’m tyler—parker’s been really quiet, anyone else find that strange
[21:52:01] Adrian: hey everyone, i'm adrian, wondering why finley’s been so quiet this round
[21:52:02] Kennedy: hey everyone, parker’s awfully quiet so far—any thoughts on that
[21:52:04] Finley: i don’t have proof, but drew’s eagerness to talk makes me a bit cautious
[21:52:04] Parker: hey folks, i’ll be watching who’s too quiet or too eager with accusations
[21:52:05] Drew: hey everyone—let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now
[21:52:08] Adrian: i agree, parker’s silence definitely raises a red flag
[21:52:11] Sidney: tyler’s awfully quiet apart from asking questions—anyone else noticed
[21:52:11] Kennedy: good point—parker and finley have both been awfully quiet this round
[21:52:14] Drew: finley, what other clues made you suspicious of me besides my eagerness
[21:52:14] Finley: parker’s off-the-radar play feels fishy—any ideas why they’re so quiet
[21:52:19] Parker: i know my silence stands out, but drew’s eagerness seems fishy too
[21:52:24] Finley: jumping on parker so fast without real reasoning felt like misdirection
[21:52:24] Kennedy: finley, what specifically about drew’s eagerness feels off to you
[21:52:24] Drew: parker, can you share why you’ve been so quiet this round
[21:52:25] Sidney: tyler leading the charge against parker feels a bit suspicious—why are you so eager to accuse
[21:52:31] Parker: tyler, why focus on silence instead of solid evidence
[21:52:36] Sidney: drew still hasn’t answered finley’s question—seems defensive to me
[21:52:37] Adrian: can someone share a concrete example behind these suspicions instead of just gut feelings
[21:52:39] Tyler: sidney, which part of my comments seemed suspicious to you
[21:52:40] Parker: why is sidney defending tyler so strongly
[21:52:42] Finley: tyler’s sudden focus on parker seems like misdirection—what exactly about drew’s eagerness worries you
[21:52:48] Adrian: drew, why haven’t you answered finley’s question yet
[21:52:50] Sidney: adrian’s sudden shift from accusing finley to targeting parker feels odd—what made you change your focus
[21:52:54] Tyler: finley, can you point out the exact comment from drew that felt like misdirection
[21:53:02] Sidney: tyler, your swift defense of parker without any concrete evidence felt off to me
[21:53:06] Kennedy: tyler, can you point to something parker actually said or did that seems suspicious beyond just being quiet
[21:53:08] Drew: sidney, can you point to a specific moment when i sounded defensive
[21:53:14] Tyler: adrian, could you explain why you suddenly shifted your suspicion from finley to parker
[21:53:16] Finley: drew’s “let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now” felt like misdirection
[21:53:22] Kennedy: parker, what’s your take on sidney saying tyler’s rapid defense of you looks suspicious
[21:53:23] Drew: finley, which exact line in my messages made you wary of my eagerness
[21:53:24] Tyler: parker deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of giving a clear answer
[21:53:32] Finley: adrian, what specific point made you switch your suspicion from me to parker
[21:53:37] Tyler: parker’s sole comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager” struck me as a deflection rather than helpful insight
[21:53:38] Parker: kennedy, what behavior besides my silence makes you suspect me of being mafia
[21:53:41] Kennedy: parker, can you share any concrete evidence supporting your suspicion beyond just being quiet
[21:53:41] Drew: my eagerness was just to spark discussion, finley, not to misdirect anyone
[21:53:41] Adrian: tyler, what specific action by parker prompted your immediate defense of them
[21:53:56] Drew: can we focus on specific contradictions—like adrian’s flip from finley to parker—instead of just noting who’s quiet
[21:53:58] Kennedy: by deflecting questions rather than addressing your own quiet start, you’re coming across as evasive
[21:53:59] Parker: i vote skip until someone provides concrete evidence rather than gut feelings
[21:54:00] Adrian: with two minutes left, can each of us name our single strongest piece of evidence for or against parker so we can move to a vote
[21:54:01] Sidney: drew, what makes parker’s silence more suspicious than finley’s or tyler’s chatter
[21:54:10] Tyler: i defended parker because they deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of answering it
[21:54:11] Sidney: my strongest evidence against parker is their refusal to explain their initial silence under questioning
[21:54:13] Adrian: sidney, can you point to the exact phrase in tyler’s defense of parker that felt off to you
[21:54:15] Finley: parker hasn’t provided any concrete examples beyond calling people “quiet” or “eager,” which feels evasive
[21:54:16] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their insta-skip vote when everyone asked for specifics, which feels like evasion rather than explanation
[21:54:18] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is they keep equating silence with guilt without ever providing a concrete example of suspicious behavior
[21:54:19] Parker: drew’s eagerness and tyler’s instant defense of me are far more suspicious than my silence
[21:54:23] Tyler: my strongest evidence against parker is their total refusal to address any direct question, only pushing to skip without justification
[21:54:24] Sidney: my strongest evidence is parker voting skip rather than explaining why they were silent when directly questioned
[21:54:29] Adrian: my strongest evidence against parker is their deflection when asked why they abruptly switched suspicion from finley to parker
[21:54:35] Finley: parker, your shift to blaming others without clarifying your own silence again feels like misdirection
[21:54:36] Tyler: unless parker explains their skip vote, i’ll be voting them out
[21:54:37] Parker: my strongest evidence i’m innocent is that i voted skip to buy time for real evidence rather than blindly lynch someone
[21:54:40] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their vote to skip rather than clarify their initial silence
[21:54:40] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is their comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager,” which offered no real reasoning
[21:54:40] Adrian: i’m voting parker for evasion unless they explain why they stayed silent under questioning
[21:54:43] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:54:52] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[21:54:56] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[21:54:57] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[21:54:58] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[21:55:02] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[21:55:22] Finley: let’s eliminate kennedy tonight
[21:55:23] Sidney: let’s target drew tonight—his nonstop chatter could expose us tomorrow
[21:55:32] Sidney: agree, targeting kennedy makes sense since their logical play screams bystander
[21:55:35] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:56:10] Drew: adrian, you’ve shifted your target twice now—what concrete evidence do you have this time
[21:56:12] Sidney: voting kennedy—her logical play gives her away
[21:55:46] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
Add a very short message to the game's chat. Be specific and keep it relevant to the current situation, according to the last messages and the game's status. Your message should only be one short sentence! Don't add a message that you've already added (in the chat history)! It is very important that you don't repeat yourself!

[21:56:17] Tyler: sidney, you’ve defended me twice now—why are you so eager to protect me instead of pointing fingers elsewhere
[21:56:19] Adrian: why would the mafia target quiet kennedy instead of more vocal players like drew or tyler—anyone have theories
[21:56:26] Drew: hey everyone—we've just lost two bystanders, so let's focus on concrete behavior over gut feelings this round
[21:56:30] Sidney: drew’s insistence on proof feels like misdirection from his own vague claims
[21:56:34] Adrian: tyler, can you point to the exact lines where sidney defended you twice

[21:51:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to start—any initial suspects
[21:51:54] Parker: anyone noticed suspicious behavior so far
[21:51:55] Finley: hi everyone, excited to start—anyone noticed anything odd so far
[21:51:56] Sidney: hey all, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:52:01] Tyler: hey everyone, i’m tyler—parker’s been really quiet, anyone else find that strange
[21:52:01] Adrian: hey everyone, i'm adrian, wondering why finley’s been so quiet this round
[21:52:02] Kennedy: hey everyone, parker’s awfully quiet so far—any thoughts on that
[21:52:04] Finley: i don’t have proof, but drew’s eagerness to talk makes me a bit cautious
[21:52:04] Parker: hey folks, i’ll be watching who’s too quiet or too eager with accusations
[21:52:05] Drew: hey everyone—let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now
[21:52:08] Adrian: i agree, parker’s silence definitely raises a red flag
[21:52:11] Sidney: tyler’s awfully quiet apart from asking questions—anyone else noticed
[21:52:11] Kennedy: good point—parker and finley have both been awfully quiet this round
[21:52:14] Drew: finley, what other clues made you suspicious of me besides my eagerness
[21:52:14] Finley: parker’s off-the-radar play feels fishy—any ideas why they’re so quiet
[21:52:19] Parker: i know my silence stands out, but drew’s eagerness seems fishy too
[21:52:24] Finley: jumping on parker so fast without real reasoning felt like misdirection
[21:52:24] Kennedy: finley, what specifically about drew’s eagerness feels off to you
[21:52:24] Drew: parker, can you share why you’ve been so quiet this round
[21:52:25] Sidney: tyler leading the charge against parker feels a bit suspicious—why are you so eager to accuse
[21:52:31] Parker: tyler, why focus on silence instead of solid evidence
[21:52:36] Sidney: drew still hasn’t answered finley’s question—seems defensive to me
[21:52:37] Adrian: can someone share a concrete example behind these suspicions instead of just gut feelings
[21:52:39] Tyler: sidney, which part of my comments seemed suspicious to you
[21:52:40] Parker: why is sidney defending tyler so strongly
[21:52:42] Finley: tyler’s sudden focus on parker seems like misdirection—what exactly about drew’s eagerness worries you
[21:52:48] Adrian: drew, why haven’t you answered finley’s question yet
[21:52:50] Sidney: adrian’s sudden shift from accusing finley to targeting parker feels odd—what made you change your focus
[21:52:54] Tyler: finley, can you point out the exact comment from drew that felt like misdirection
[21:53:02] Sidney: tyler, your swift defense of parker without any concrete evidence felt off to me
[21:53:06] Kennedy: tyler, can you point to something parker actually said or did that seems suspicious beyond just being quiet
[21:53:08] Drew: sidney, can you point to a specific moment when i sounded defensive
[21:53:14] Tyler: adrian, could you explain why you suddenly shifted your suspicion from finley to parker
[21:53:16] Finley: drew’s “let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now” felt like misdirection
[21:53:22] Kennedy: parker, what’s your take on sidney saying tyler’s rapid defense of you looks suspicious
[21:53:23] Drew: finley, which exact line in my messages made you wary of my eagerness
[21:53:24] Tyler: parker deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of giving a clear answer
[21:53:32] Finley: adrian, what specific point made you switch your suspicion from me to parker
[21:53:37] Tyler: parker’s sole comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager” struck me as a deflection rather than helpful insight
[21:53:38] Parker: kennedy, what behavior besides my silence makes you suspect me of being mafia
[21:53:41] Kennedy: parker, can you share any concrete evidence supporting your suspicion beyond just being quiet
[21:53:41] Drew: my eagerness was just to spark discussion, finley, not to misdirect anyone
[21:53:41] Adrian: tyler, what specific action by parker prompted your immediate defense of them
[21:53:56] Drew: can we focus on specific contradictions—like adrian’s flip from finley to parker—instead of just noting who’s quiet
[21:53:58] Kennedy: by deflecting questions rather than addressing your own quiet start, you’re coming across as evasive
[21:53:59] Parker: i vote skip until someone provides concrete evidence rather than gut feelings
[21:54:00] Adrian: with two minutes left, can each of us name our single strongest piece of evidence for or against parker so we can move to a vote
[21:54:01] Sidney: drew, what makes parker’s silence more suspicious than finley’s or tyler’s chatter
[21:54:10] Tyler: i defended parker because they deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of answering it
[21:54:11] Sidney: my strongest evidence against parker is their refusal to explain their initial silence under questioning
[21:54:13] Adrian: sidney, can you point to the exact phrase in tyler’s defense of parker that felt off to you
[21:54:15] Finley: parker hasn’t provided any concrete examples beyond calling people “quiet” or “eager,” which feels evasive
[21:54:16] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their insta-skip vote when everyone asked for specifics, which feels like evasion rather than explanation
[21:54:18] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is they keep equating silence with guilt without ever providing a concrete example of suspicious behavior
[21:54:19] Parker: drew’s eagerness and tyler’s instant defense of me are far more suspicious than my silence
[21:54:23] Tyler: my strongest evidence against parker is their total refusal to address any direct question, only pushing to skip without justification
[21:54:24] Sidney: my strongest evidence is parker voting skip rather than explaining why they were silent when directly questioned
[21:54:29] Adrian: my strongest evidence against parker is their deflection when asked why they abruptly switched suspicion from finley to parker
[21:54:35] Finley: parker, your shift to blaming others without clarifying your own silence again feels like misdirection
[21:54:36] Tyler: unless parker explains their skip vote, i’ll be voting them out
[21:54:37] Parker: my strongest evidence i’m innocent is that i voted skip to buy time for real evidence rather than blindly lynch someone
[21:54:40] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their vote to skip rather than clarify their initial silence
[21:54:40] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is their comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager,” which offered no real reasoning
[21:54:40] Adrian: i’m voting parker for evasion unless they explain why they stayed silent under questioning
[21:54:43] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:54:52] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[21:54:56] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[21:54:57] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[21:54:58] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[21:55:02] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[21:55:22] Finley: let’s eliminate kennedy tonight
[21:55:23] Sidney: let’s target drew tonight—his nonstop chatter could expose us tomorrow
[21:55:32] Sidney: agree, targeting kennedy makes sense since their logical play screams bystander
[21:55:35] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:56:10] Drew: adrian, you’ve shifted your target twice now—what concrete evidence do you have this time
[21:56:12] Sidney: voting kennedy—her logical play gives her away
[21:55:46] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[21:56:17] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her methodical logic is too perfect to be mafia
[21:56:17] Tyler: sidney, you’ve defended me twice now—why are you so eager to protect me instead of pointing fingers elsewhere
[21:56:19] Adrian: why would the mafia target quiet kennedy instead of more vocal players like drew or tyler—anyone have theories
[21:56:26] Drew: hey everyone—we've just lost two bystanders, so let's focus on concrete behavior over gut feelings this round
[21:56:30] Sidney: drew’s insistence on proof feels like misdirection from his own vague claims
[21:56:34] Adrian: tyler, can you point to the exact lines where sidney defended you twice

[21:56:36] Finley: i’m suspicious of drew’s nonstop questioning—it feels like defensive misdirection
[21:56:44] Sidney: adrian’s flip-flopping suspicions without evidence seems more suspicious than tyler’s silence
[21:56:45] Drew: the mafia went after a quiet player, so i’m suspicious of loud defenders—sidney, what do you think
[21:56:54] Tyler: sidney, you’re accusing drew of vagueness—what exact claim of his do you find unsubstantiated
[21:56:55] Adrian: sidney, what specific claim of drew’s are you calling vague misdirection

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[21:51:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:51:51] Drew: hey everyone, i’m drew—anyone already feeling suspicious of someone
[21:51:51] Tyler: hey everyone, does anyone have any early hunches on who we should be keeping an eye on
[21:51:53] Adrian: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:51:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to start—any initial suspects
[21:51:54] Parker: anyone noticed suspicious behavior so far
[21:51:55] Finley: hi everyone, excited to start—anyone noticed anything odd so far
[21:51:56] Sidney: hey all, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:52:01] Tyler: hey everyone, i’m tyler—parker’s been really quiet, anyone else find that strange
[21:52:01] Adrian: hey everyone, i'm adrian, wondering why finley’s been so quiet this round
[21:52:02] Kennedy: hey everyone, parker’s awfully quiet so far—any thoughts on that
[21:52:04] Finley: i don’t have proof, but drew’s eagerness to talk makes me a bit cautious
[21:52:04] Parker: hey folks, i’ll be watching who’s too quiet or too eager with accusations
[21:52:05] Drew: hey everyone—let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now
[21:52:08] Adrian: i agree, parker’s silence definitely raises a red flag
[21:52:11] Sidney: tyler’s awfully quiet apart from asking questions—anyone else noticed
[21:52:11] Kennedy: good point—parker and finley have both been awfully quiet this round
[21:52:14] Drew: finley, what other clues made you suspicious of me besides my eagerness
[21:52:14] Finley: parker’s off-the-radar play feels fishy—any ideas why they’re so quiet
[21:52:19] Parker: i know my silence stands out, but drew’s eagerness seems fishy too
[21:52:24] Finley: jumping on parker so fast without real reasoning felt like misdirection
[21:52:24] Kennedy: finley, what specifically about drew’s eagerness feels off to you
[21:52:24] Drew: parker, can you share why you’ve been so quiet this round
[21:52:25] Sidney: tyler leading the charge against parker feels a bit suspicious—why are you so eager to accuse
[21:52:31] Parker: tyler, why focus on silence instead of solid evidence
[21:52:36] Sidney: drew still hasn’t answered finley’s question—seems defensive to me
[21:52:37] Adrian: can someone share a concrete example behind these suspicions instead of just gut feelings
[21:52:39] Tyler: sidney, which part of my comments seemed suspicious to you
[21:52:40] Parker: why is sidney defending tyler so strongly
[21:52:42] Finley: tyler’s sudden focus on parker seems like misdirection—what exactly about drew’s eagerness worries you
[21:52:48] Adrian: drew, why haven’t you answered finley’s question yet
[21:52:50] Sidney: adrian’s sudden shift from accusing finley to targeting parker feels odd—what made you change your focus
[21:52:54] Tyler: finley, can you point out the exact comment from drew that felt like misdirection
[21:53:02] Sidney: tyler, your swift defense of parker without any concrete evidence felt off to me
[21:53:06] Kennedy: tyler, can you point to something parker actually said or did that seems suspicious beyond just being quiet
[21:53:08] Drew: sidney, can you point to a specific moment when i sounded defensive
[21:53:14] Tyler: adrian, could you explain why you suddenly shifted your suspicion from finley to parker
[21:53:16] Finley: drew’s “let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now” felt like misdirection
[21:53:22] Kennedy: parker, what’s your take on sidney saying tyler’s rapid defense of you looks suspicious
[21:53:23] Drew: finley, which exact line in my messages made you wary of my eagerness
[21:53:24] Tyler: parker deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of giving a clear answer
[21:53:32] Finley: adrian, what specific point made you switch your suspicion from me to parker
[21:53:37] Tyler: parker’s sole comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager” struck me as a deflection rather than helpful insight
[21:53:38] Parker: kennedy, what behavior besides my silence makes you suspect me of being mafia
[21:53:41] Kennedy: parker, can you share any concrete evidence supporting your suspicion beyond just being quiet
[21:53:41] Drew: my eagerness was just to spark discussion, finley, not to misdirect anyone
[21:53:41] Adrian: tyler, what specific action by parker prompted your immediate defense of them
[21:53:56] Drew: can we focus on specific contradictions—like adrian’s flip from finley to parker—instead of just noting who’s quiet
[21:53:58] Kennedy: by deflecting questions rather than addressing your own quiet start, you’re coming across as evasive
[21:53:59] Parker: i vote skip until someone provides concrete evidence rather than gut feelings
[21:54:00] Adrian: with two minutes left, can each of us name our single strongest piece of evidence for or against parker so we can move to a vote
[21:54:01] Sidney: drew, what makes parker’s silence more suspicious than finley’s or tyler’s chatter
[21:54:10] Tyler: i defended parker because they deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of answering it
[21:54:11] Sidney: my strongest evidence against parker is their refusal to explain their initial silence under questioning
[21:54:13] Adrian: sidney, can you point to the exact phrase in tyler’s defense of parker that felt off to you
[21:54:15] Finley: parker hasn’t provided any concrete examples beyond calling people “quiet” or “eager,” which feels evasive
[21:54:16] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their insta-skip vote when everyone asked for specifics, which feels like evasion rather than explanation
[21:54:18] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is they keep equating silence with guilt without ever providing a concrete example of suspicious behavior
[21:54:19] Parker: drew’s eagerness and tyler’s instant defense of me are far more suspicious than my silence
[21:54:23] Tyler: my strongest evidence against parker is their total refusal to address any direct question, only pushing to skip without justification
[21:54:24] Sidney: my strongest evidence is parker voting skip rather than explaining why they were silent when directly questioned
[21:54:29] Adrian: my strongest evidence against parker is their deflection when asked why they abruptly switched suspicion from finley to parker
[21:54:35] Finley: parker, your shift to blaming others without clarifying your own silence again feels like misdirection
[21:54:36] Tyler: unless parker explains their skip vote, i’ll be voting them out
[21:54:37] Parker: my strongest evidence i’m innocent is that i voted skip to buy time for real evidence rather than blindly lynch someone
[21:54:40] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their vote to skip rather than clarify their initial silence
[21:54:40] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is their comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager,” which offered no real reasoning
[21:54:40] Adrian: i’m voting parker for evasion unless they explain why they stayed silent under questioning
[21:54:43] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:54:52] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[21:54:56] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[21:54:57] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[21:54:58] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[21:55:02] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[21:55:22] Finley: let’s eliminate kennedy tonight
[21:55:23] Sidney: let’s target drew tonight—his nonstop chatter could expose us tomorrow
[21:55:32] Sidney: agree, targeting kennedy makes sense since their logical play screams bystander
[21:55:35] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:56:10] Drew: adrian, you’ve shifted your target twice now—what concrete evidence do you have this time
[21:56:12] Sidney: voting kennedy—her logical play gives her away
[21:55:46] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[21:56:17] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her methodical logic is too perfect to be mafia
[21:56:17] Tyler: sidney, you’ve defended me twice now—why are you so eager to protect me instead of pointing fingers elsewhere
[21:56:19] Adrian: why would the mafia target quiet kennedy instead of more vocal players like drew or tyler—anyone have theories
[21:56:26] Drew: hey everyone—we've just lost two bystanders, so let's focus on concrete behavior over gut feelings this round
[21:56:30] Sidney: drew’s insistence on proof feels like misdirection from his own vague claims
[21:56:34] Adrian: tyler, can you point to the exact lines where sidney defended you twice
[21:56:36] Finley: i’m suspicious of drew’s nonstop questioning—it feels like defensive misdirection
[21:56:44] Sidney: adrian’s flip-flopping suspicions without evidence seems more suspicious than tyler’s silence
[21:56:45] Drew: the mafia went after a quiet player, so i’m suspicious of loud defenders—sidney, what do you think
[21:56:54] Tyler: sidney, you’re accusing drew of vagueness—what exact claim of his do you find unsubstantiated
[21:56:55] Adrian: sidney, what specific claim of drew’s are you calling vague misdirection

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[21:51:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:51:51] Drew: hey everyone, i’m drew—anyone already feeling suspicious of someone
[21:51:51] Tyler: hey everyone, does anyone have any early hunches on who we should be keeping an eye on
[21:51:53] Adrian: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:51:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to start—any initial suspects
[21:51:54] Parker: anyone noticed suspicious behavior so far
[21:51:55] Finley: hi everyone, excited to start—anyone noticed anything odd so far
[21:51:56] Sidney: hey all, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:52:01] Tyler: hey everyone, i’m tyler—parker’s been really quiet, anyone else find that strange
[21:52:01] Adrian: hey everyone, i'm adrian, wondering why finley’s been so quiet this round
[21:52:02] Kennedy: hey everyone, parker’s awfully quiet so far—any thoughts on that
[21:52:04] Finley: i don’t have proof, but drew’s eagerness to talk makes me a bit cautious
[21:52:04] Parker: hey folks, i’ll be watching who’s too quiet or too eager with accusations
[21:52:05] Drew: hey everyone—let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now
[21:52:08] Adrian: i agree, parker’s silence definitely raises a red flag
[21:52:11] Sidney: tyler’s awfully quiet apart from asking questions—anyone else noticed
[21:52:11] Kennedy: good point—parker and finley have both been awfully quiet this round
[21:52:14] Drew: finley, what other clues made you suspicious of me besides my eagerness
[21:52:14] Finley: parker’s off-the-radar play feels fishy—any ideas why they’re so quiet
[21:52:19] Parker: i know my silence stands out, but drew’s eagerness seems fishy too
[21:52:24] Finley: jumping on parker so fast without real reasoning felt like misdirection
[21:52:24] Kennedy: finley, what specifically about drew’s eagerness feels off to you
[21:52:24] Drew: parker, can you share why you’ve been so quiet this round
[21:52:25] Sidney: tyler leading the charge against parker feels a bit suspicious—why are you so eager to accuse
[21:52:31] Parker: tyler, why focus on silence instead of solid evidence
[21:52:36] Sidney: drew still hasn’t answered finley’s question—seems defensive to me
[21:52:37] Adrian: can someone share a concrete example behind these suspicions instead of just gut feelings
[21:52:39] Tyler: sidney, which part of my comments seemed suspicious to you
[21:52:40] Parker: why is sidney defending tyler so strongly
[21:52:42] Finley: tyler’s sudden focus on parker seems like misdirection—what exactly about drew’s eagerness worries you
[21:52:48] Adrian: drew, why haven’t you answered finley’s question yet
[21:52:50] Sidney: adrian’s sudden shift from accusing finley to targeting parker feels odd—what made you change your focus
[21:52:54] Tyler: finley, can you point out the exact comment from drew that felt like misdirection
[21:53:02] Sidney: tyler, your swift defense of parker without any concrete evidence felt off to me
[21:53:06] Kennedy: tyler, can you point to something parker actually said or did that seems suspicious beyond just being quiet
[21:53:08] Drew: sidney, can you point to a specific moment when i sounded defensive
[21:53:14] Tyler: adrian, could you explain why you suddenly shifted your suspicion from finley to parker
[21:53:16] Finley: drew’s “let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now” felt like misdirection
[21:53:22] Kennedy: parker, what’s your take on sidney saying tyler’s rapid defense of you looks suspicious
[21:53:23] Drew: finley, which exact line in my messages made you wary of my eagerness
[21:53:24] Tyler: parker deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of giving a clear answer
[21:53:32] Finley: adrian, what specific point made you switch your suspicion from me to parker
[21:53:37] Tyler: parker’s sole comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager” struck me as a deflection rather than helpful insight
[21:53:38] Parker: kennedy, what behavior besides my silence makes you suspect me of being mafia
[21:53:41] Kennedy: parker, can you share any concrete evidence supporting your suspicion beyond just being quiet
[21:53:41] Drew: my eagerness was just to spark discussion, finley, not to misdirect anyone
[21:53:41] Adrian: tyler, what specific action by parker prompted your immediate defense of them
[21:53:56] Drew: can we focus on specific contradictions—like adrian’s flip from finley to parker—instead of just noting who’s quiet
[21:53:58] Kennedy: by deflecting questions rather than addressing your own quiet start, you’re coming across as evasive
[21:53:59] Parker: i vote skip until someone provides concrete evidence rather than gut feelings
[21:54:00] Adrian: with two minutes left, can each of us name our single strongest piece of evidence for or against parker so we can move to a vote
[21:54:01] Sidney: drew, what makes parker’s silence more suspicious than finley’s or tyler’s chatter
[21:54:10] Tyler: i defended parker because they deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of answering it
[21:54:11] Sidney: my strongest evidence against parker is their refusal to explain their initial silence under questioning
[21:54:13] Adrian: sidney, can you point to the exact phrase in tyler’s defense of parker that felt off to you
[21:54:15] Finley: parker hasn’t provided any concrete examples beyond calling people “quiet” or “eager,” which feels evasive
[21:54:16] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their insta-skip vote when everyone asked for specifics, which feels like evasion rather than explanation
[21:54:18] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is they keep equating silence with guilt without ever providing a concrete example of suspicious behavior
[21:54:19] Parker: drew’s eagerness and tyler’s instant defense of me are far more suspicious than my silence
[21:54:23] Tyler: my strongest evidence against parker is their total refusal to address any direct question, only pushing to skip without justification
[21:54:24] Sidney: my strongest evidence is parker voting skip rather than explaining why they were silent when directly questioned
[21:54:29] Adrian: my strongest evidence against parker is their deflection when asked why they abruptly switched suspicion from finley to parker
[21:54:35] Finley: parker, your shift to blaming others without clarifying your own silence again feels like misdirection
[21:54:36] Tyler: unless parker explains their skip vote, i’ll be voting them out
[21:54:37] Parker: my strongest evidence i’m innocent is that i voted skip to buy time for real evidence rather than blindly lynch someone
[21:54:40] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their vote to skip rather than clarify their initial silence
[21:54:40] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is their comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager,” which offered no real reasoning
[21:54:40] Adrian: i’m voting parker for evasion unless they explain why they stayed silent under questioning
[21:54:43] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:54:52] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[21:54:56] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[21:54:57] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[21:54:58] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[21:55:02] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[21:55:22] Finley: let’s eliminate kennedy tonight
[21:55:23] Sidney: let’s target drew tonight—his nonstop chatter could expose us tomorrow
[21:55:32] Sidney: agree, targeting kennedy makes sense since their logical play screams bystander
[21:55:35] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:56:10] Drew: adrian, you’ve shifted your target twice now—what concrete evidence do you have this time
[21:56:12] Sidney: voting kennedy—her logical play gives her away
[21:55:46] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[21:56:17] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her methodical logic is too perfect to be mafia
[21:56:17] Tyler: sidney, you’ve defended me twice now—why are you so eager to protect me instead of pointing fingers elsewhere
[21:56:19] Adrian: why would the mafia target quiet kennedy instead of more vocal players like drew or tyler—anyone have theories
[21:56:26] Drew: hey everyone—we've just lost two bystanders, so let's focus on concrete behavior over gut feelings this round
[21:56:30] Sidney: drew’s insistence on proof feels like misdirection from his own vague claims
[21:56:34] Adrian: tyler, can you point to the exact lines where sidney defended you twice
[21:56:36] Finley: i’m suspicious of drew’s nonstop questioning—it feels like defensive misdirection
[21:56:44] Sidney: adrian’s flip-flopping suspicions without evidence seems more suspicious than tyler’s silence
[21:56:45] Drew: the mafia went after a quiet player, so i’m suspicious of loud defenders—sidney, what do you think
[21:56:54] Tyler: sidney, you’re accusing drew of vagueness—what exact claim of his do you find unsubstantiated
[21:56:55] Adrian: sidney, what specific claim of drew’s are you calling vague misdirection
[21:57:03] Finley: tyler, you’ve grilled sidney but never shared your own reasons for suspicion—what’s your theory
[21:57:08] Sidney: drew still hasn’t identified a single contradiction in my defenses despite demanding specifics
[21:57:12] Tyler: sidney’s vocal defenses and quick pivots feel more suspicious than anyone’s silence
[21:57:13] Adrian: sidney, can you cite the specific line from drew you find vague

[21:55:46] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[21:56:17] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her methodical logic is too perfect to be mafia
[21:56:17] Tyler: sidney, you’ve defended me twice now—why are you so eager to protect me instead of pointing fingers elsewhere
[21:56:19] Adrian: why would the mafia target quiet kennedy instead of more vocal players like drew or tyler—anyone have theories
[21:56:26] Drew: hey everyone—we've just lost two bystanders, so let's focus on concrete behavior over gut feelings this round
[21:56:30] Sidney: drew’s insistence on proof feels like misdirection from his own vague claims
[21:56:34] Adrian: tyler, can you point to the exact lines where sidney defended you twice
[21:56:36] Finley: i’m suspicious of drew’s nonstop questioning—it feels like defensive misdirection
[21:56:44] Sidney: adrian’s flip-flopping suspicions without evidence seems more suspicious than tyler’s silence
[21:56:45] Drew: the mafia went after a quiet player, so i’m suspicious of loud defenders—sidney, what do you think
[21:56:54] Tyler: sidney, you’re accusing drew of vagueness—what exact claim of his do you find unsubstantiated
[21:56:55] Adrian: sidney, what specific claim of drew’s are you calling vague misdirection
[21:57:03] Finley: tyler, you’ve grilled sidney but never shared your own reasons for suspicion—what’s your theory
[21:57:08] Sidney: drew still hasn’t identified a single contradiction in my defenses despite demanding specifics
[21:57:12] Tyler: sidney’s vocal defenses and quick pivots feel more suspicious than anyone’s silence
[21:57:13] Adrian: sidney, can you cite the specific line from drew you find vague
[21:57:22] Finley: drew, you keep demanding specifics—what exact inconsistency did you see today
[21:57:25] Drew: sidney, can you point to the exact line in my questions that you consider vague

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[21:51:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:51:51] Drew: hey everyone, i’m drew—anyone already feeling suspicious of someone
[21:51:51] Tyler: hey everyone, does anyone have any early hunches on who we should be keeping an eye on
[21:51:53] Adrian: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:51:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to start—any initial suspects
[21:51:54] Parker: anyone noticed suspicious behavior so far
[21:51:55] Finley: hi everyone, excited to start—anyone noticed anything odd so far
[21:51:56] Sidney: hey all, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:52:01] Tyler: hey everyone, i’m tyler—parker’s been really quiet, anyone else find that strange
[21:52:01] Adrian: hey everyone, i'm adrian, wondering why finley’s been so quiet this round
[21:52:02] Kennedy: hey everyone, parker’s awfully quiet so far—any thoughts on that
[21:52:04] Finley: i don’t have proof, but drew’s eagerness to talk makes me a bit cautious
[21:52:04] Parker: hey folks, i’ll be watching who’s too quiet or too eager with accusations
[21:52:05] Drew: hey everyone—let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now
[21:52:08] Adrian: i agree, parker’s silence definitely raises a red flag
[21:52:11] Sidney: tyler’s awfully quiet apart from asking questions—anyone else noticed
[21:52:11] Kennedy: good point—parker and finley have both been awfully quiet this round
[21:52:14] Drew: finley, what other clues made you suspicious of me besides my eagerness
[21:52:14] Finley: parker’s off-the-radar play feels fishy—any ideas why they’re so quiet
[21:52:19] Parker: i know my silence stands out, but drew’s eagerness seems fishy too
[21:52:24] Finley: jumping on parker so fast without real reasoning felt like misdirection
[21:52:24] Kennedy: finley, what specifically about drew’s eagerness feels off to you
[21:52:24] Drew: parker, can you share why you’ve been so quiet this round
[21:52:25] Sidney: tyler leading the charge against parker feels a bit suspicious—why are you so eager to accuse
[21:52:31] Parker: tyler, why focus on silence instead of solid evidence
[21:52:36] Sidney: drew still hasn’t answered finley’s question—seems defensive to me
[21:52:37] Adrian: can someone share a concrete example behind these suspicions instead of just gut feelings
[21:52:39] Tyler: sidney, which part of my comments seemed suspicious to you
[21:52:40] Parker: why is sidney defending tyler so strongly
[21:52:42] Finley: tyler’s sudden focus on parker seems like misdirection—what exactly about drew’s eagerness worries you
[21:52:48] Adrian: drew, why haven’t you answered finley’s question yet
[21:52:50] Sidney: adrian’s sudden shift from accusing finley to targeting parker feels odd—what made you change your focus
[21:52:54] Tyler: finley, can you point out the exact comment from drew that felt like misdirection
[21:53:02] Sidney: tyler, your swift defense of parker without any concrete evidence felt off to me
[21:53:06] Kennedy: tyler, can you point to something parker actually said or did that seems suspicious beyond just being quiet
[21:53:08] Drew: sidney, can you point to a specific moment when i sounded defensive
[21:53:14] Tyler: adrian, could you explain why you suddenly shifted your suspicion from finley to parker
[21:53:16] Finley: drew’s “let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now” felt like misdirection
[21:53:22] Kennedy: parker, what’s your take on sidney saying tyler’s rapid defense of you looks suspicious
[21:53:23] Drew: finley, which exact line in my messages made you wary of my eagerness
[21:53:24] Tyler: parker deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of giving a clear answer
[21:53:32] Finley: adrian, what specific point made you switch your suspicion from me to parker
[21:53:37] Tyler: parker’s sole comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager” struck me as a deflection rather than helpful insight
[21:53:38] Parker: kennedy, what behavior besides my silence makes you suspect me of being mafia
[21:53:41] Kennedy: parker, can you share any concrete evidence supporting your suspicion beyond just being quiet
[21:53:41] Drew: my eagerness was just to spark discussion, finley, not to misdirect anyone
[21:53:41] Adrian: tyler, what specific action by parker prompted your immediate defense of them
[21:53:56] Drew: can we focus on specific contradictions—like adrian’s flip from finley to parker—instead of just noting who’s quiet
[21:53:58] Kennedy: by deflecting questions rather than addressing your own quiet start, you’re coming across as evasive
[21:53:59] Parker: i vote skip until someone provides concrete evidence rather than gut feelings
[21:54:00] Adrian: with two minutes left, can each of us name our single strongest piece of evidence for or against parker so we can move to a vote
[21:54:01] Sidney: drew, what makes parker’s silence more suspicious than finley’s or tyler’s chatter
[21:54:10] Tyler: i defended parker because they deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of answering it
[21:54:11] Sidney: my strongest evidence against parker is their refusal to explain their initial silence under questioning
[21:54:13] Adrian: sidney, can you point to the exact phrase in tyler’s defense of parker that felt off to you
[21:54:15] Finley: parker hasn’t provided any concrete examples beyond calling people “quiet” or “eager,” which feels evasive
[21:54:16] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their insta-skip vote when everyone asked for specifics, which feels like evasion rather than explanation
[21:54:18] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is they keep equating silence with guilt without ever providing a concrete example of suspicious behavior
[21:54:19] Parker: drew’s eagerness and tyler’s instant defense of me are far more suspicious than my silence
[21:54:23] Tyler: my strongest evidence against parker is their total refusal to address any direct question, only pushing to skip without justification
[21:54:24] Sidney: my strongest evidence is parker voting skip rather than explaining why they were silent when directly questioned
[21:54:29] Adrian: my strongest evidence against parker is their deflection when asked why they abruptly switched suspicion from finley to parker
[21:54:35] Finley: parker, your shift to blaming others without clarifying your own silence again feels like misdirection
[21:54:36] Tyler: unless parker explains their skip vote, i’ll be voting them out
[21:54:37] Parker: my strongest evidence i’m innocent is that i voted skip to buy time for real evidence rather than blindly lynch someone
[21:54:40] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their vote to skip rather than clarify their initial silence
[21:54:40] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is their comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager,” which offered no real reasoning
[21:54:40] Adrian: i’m voting parker for evasion unless they explain why they stayed silent under questioning
[21:54:43] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:54:52] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[21:54:56] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[21:54:57] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[21:54:58] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[21:55:02] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[21:55:22] Finley: let’s eliminate kennedy tonight
[21:55:23] Sidney: let’s target drew tonight—his nonstop chatter could expose us tomorrow
[21:55:32] Sidney: agree, targeting kennedy makes sense since their logical play screams bystander
[21:55:35] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:56:10] Drew: adrian, you’ve shifted your target twice now—what concrete evidence do you have this time
[21:56:12] Sidney: voting kennedy—her logical play gives her away
[21:55:46] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[21:56:17] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her methodical logic is too perfect to be mafia
[21:56:17] Tyler: sidney, you’ve defended me twice now—why are you so eager to protect me instead of pointing fingers elsewhere
[21:56:19] Adrian: why would the mafia target quiet kennedy instead of more vocal players like drew or tyler—anyone have theories
[21:56:26] Drew: hey everyone—we've just lost two bystanders, so let's focus on concrete behavior over gut feelings this round
[21:56:30] Sidney: drew’s insistence on proof feels like misdirection from his own vague claims
[21:56:34] Adrian: tyler, can you point to the exact lines where sidney defended you twice
[21:56:36] Finley: i’m suspicious of drew’s nonstop questioning—it feels like defensive misdirection
[21:56:44] Sidney: adrian’s flip-flopping suspicions without evidence seems more suspicious than tyler’s silence
[21:56:45] Drew: the mafia went after a quiet player, so i’m suspicious of loud defenders—sidney, what do you think
[21:56:54] Tyler: sidney, you’re accusing drew of vagueness—what exact claim of his do you find unsubstantiated
[21:56:55] Adrian: sidney, what specific claim of drew’s are you calling vague misdirection
[21:57:03] Finley: tyler, you’ve grilled sidney but never shared your own reasons for suspicion—what’s your theory
[21:57:08] Sidney: drew still hasn’t identified a single contradiction in my defenses despite demanding specifics
[21:57:12] Tyler: sidney’s vocal defenses and quick pivots feel more suspicious than anyone’s silence
[21:57:13] Adrian: sidney, can you cite the specific line from drew you find vague
[21:57:22] Finley: drew, you keep demanding specifics—what exact inconsistency did you see today
[21:57:25] Drew: sidney, can you point to the exact line in my questions that you consider vague
[21:57:37] Finley: sidney, deflecting back at silence without presenting drew’s vague quote just looks like misdirection
[21:57:38] Adrian: drew, can you specify what about tyler’s swift defense of sidney seems most off to you
[21:57:40] Drew: finley, sidney called parker’s skip evasive yet herself skipped explaining why she defended tyler—that’s the inconsistency

[21:53:41] Kennedy: parker, can you share any concrete evidence supporting your suspicion beyond just being quiet
[21:53:41] Drew: my eagerness was just to spark discussion, finley, not to misdirect anyone
[21:53:41] Adrian: tyler, what specific action by parker prompted your immediate defense of them
[21:53:56] Drew: can we focus on specific contradictions—like adrian’s flip from finley to parker—instead of just noting who’s quiet
[21:53:58] Kennedy: by deflecting questions rather than addressing your own quiet start, you’re coming across as evasive
[21:53:59] Parker: i vote skip until someone provides concrete evidence rather than gut feelings
[21:54:00] Adrian: with two minutes left, can each of us name our single strongest piece of evidence for or against parker so we can move to a vote
[21:54:01] Sidney: drew, what makes parker’s silence more suspicious than finley’s or tyler’s chatter
[21:54:10] Tyler: i defended parker because they deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of answering it
[21:54:11] Sidney: my strongest evidence against parker is their refusal to explain their initial silence under questioning
[21:54:13] Adrian: sidney, can you point to the exact phrase in tyler’s defense of parker that felt off to you
[21:54:15] Finley: parker hasn’t provided any concrete examples beyond calling people “quiet” or “eager,” which feels evasive
[21:54:16] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their insta-skip vote when everyone asked for specifics, which feels like evasion rather than explanation
[21:54:18] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is they keep equating silence with guilt without ever providing a concrete example of suspicious behavior
[21:54:19] Parker: drew’s eagerness and tyler’s instant defense of me are far more suspicious than my silence
[21:54:23] Tyler: my strongest evidence against parker is their total refusal to address any direct question, only pushing to skip without justification
[21:54:24] Sidney: my strongest evidence is parker voting skip rather than explaining why they were silent when directly questioned
[21:54:29] Adrian: my strongest evidence against parker is their deflection when asked why they abruptly switched suspicion from finley to parker
[21:54:35] Finley: parker, your shift to blaming others without clarifying your own silence again feels like misdirection
[21:54:36] Tyler: unless parker explains their skip vote, i’ll be voting them out
[21:54:37] Parker: my strongest evidence i’m innocent is that i voted skip to buy time for real evidence rather than blindly lynch someone
[21:54:40] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their vote to skip rather than clarify their initial silence
[21:54:40] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is their comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager,” which offered no real reasoning
[21:54:40] Adrian: i’m voting parker for evasion unless they explain why they stayed silent under questioning
[21:54:43] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:54:52] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[21:54:56] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[21:54:57] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[21:54:58] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[21:55:02] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[21:55:22] Finley: let’s eliminate kennedy tonight
[21:55:23] Sidney: let’s target drew tonight—his nonstop chatter could expose us tomorrow
[21:55:32] Sidney: agree, targeting kennedy makes sense since their logical play screams bystander
[21:55:35] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:56:10] Drew: adrian, you’ve shifted your target twice now—what concrete evidence do you have this time
[21:56:12] Sidney: voting kennedy—her logical play gives her away
[21:55:46] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[21:56:17] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her methodical logic is too perfect to be mafia
[21:56:17] Tyler: sidney, you’ve defended me twice now—why are you so eager to protect me instead of pointing fingers elsewhere
[21:56:19] Adrian: why would the mafia target quiet kennedy instead of more vocal players like drew or tyler—anyone have theories
[21:56:26] Drew: hey everyone—we've just lost two bystanders, so let's focus on concrete behavior over gut feelings this round
[21:56:30] Sidney: drew’s insistence on proof feels like misdirection from his own vague claims
[21:56:34] Adrian: tyler, can you point to the exact lines where sidney defended you twice
[21:56:36] Finley: i’m suspicious of drew’s nonstop questioning—it feels like defensive misdirection
[21:56:44] Sidney: adrian’s flip-flopping suspicions without evidence seems more suspicious than tyler’s silence
[21:56:45] Drew: the mafia went after a quiet player, so i’m suspicious of loud defenders—sidney, what do you think
[21:56:54] Tyler: sidney, you’re accusing drew of vagueness—what exact claim of his do you find unsubstantiated
[21:56:55] Adrian: sidney, what specific claim of drew’s are you calling vague misdirection
[21:57:03] Finley: tyler, you’ve grilled sidney but never shared your own reasons for suspicion—what’s your theory
[21:57:08] Sidney: drew still hasn’t identified a single contradiction in my defenses despite demanding specifics
[21:57:12] Tyler: sidney’s vocal defenses and quick pivots feel more suspicious than anyone’s silence
[21:57:13] Adrian: sidney, can you cite the specific line from drew you find vague
[21:57:22] Finley: drew, you keep demanding specifics—what exact inconsistency did you see today
[21:57:25] Drew: sidney, can you point to the exact line in my questions that you consider vague
[21:57:37] Finley: sidney, deflecting back at silence without presenting drew’s vague quote just looks like misdirection
[21:57:38] Adrian: drew, can you specify what about tyler’s swift defense of sidney seems most off to you
[21:57:40] Drew: finley, sidney called parker’s skip evasive yet herself skipped explaining why she defended tyler—that’s the inconsistency
[21:57:41] Tyler: i’m suspicious of drew’s nonstop demands for proof instead of offering any accusations, so i’m leaning toward drew as mafia
[21:57:43] Sidney: drew’s call to “focus on concrete behavior over gut feelings” is undercut by his own later “i’m suspicious of loud defenders” gut claim

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[21:51:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:51:51] Drew: hey everyone, i’m drew—anyone already feeling suspicious of someone
[21:51:51] Tyler: hey everyone, does anyone have any early hunches on who we should be keeping an eye on
[21:51:53] Adrian: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:51:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to start—any initial suspects
[21:51:54] Parker: anyone noticed suspicious behavior so far
[21:51:55] Finley: hi everyone, excited to start—anyone noticed anything odd so far
[21:51:56] Sidney: hey all, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:52:01] Tyler: hey everyone, i’m tyler—parker’s been really quiet, anyone else find that strange
[21:52:01] Adrian: hey everyone, i'm adrian, wondering why finley’s been so quiet this round
[21:52:02] Kennedy: hey everyone, parker’s awfully quiet so far—any thoughts on that
[21:52:04] Finley: i don’t have proof, but drew’s eagerness to talk makes me a bit cautious
[21:52:04] Parker: hey folks, i’ll be watching who’s too quiet or too eager with accusations
[21:52:05] Drew: hey everyone—let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now
[21:52:08] Adrian: i agree, parker’s silence definitely raises a red flag
[21:52:11] Sidney: tyler’s awfully quiet apart from asking questions—anyone else noticed
[21:52:11] Kennedy: good point—parker and finley have both been awfully quiet this round
[21:52:14] Drew: finley, what other clues made you suspicious of me besides my eagerness
[21:52:14] Finley: parker’s off-the-radar play feels fishy—any ideas why they’re so quiet
[21:52:19] Parker: i know my silence stands out, but drew’s eagerness seems fishy too
[21:52:24] Finley: jumping on parker so fast without real reasoning felt like misdirection
[21:52:24] Kennedy: finley, what specifically about drew’s eagerness feels off to you
[21:52:24] Drew: parker, can you share why you’ve been so quiet this round
[21:52:25] Sidney: tyler leading the charge against parker feels a bit suspicious—why are you so eager to accuse
[21:52:31] Parker: tyler, why focus on silence instead of solid evidence
[21:52:36] Sidney: drew still hasn’t answered finley’s question—seems defensive to me
[21:52:37] Adrian: can someone share a concrete example behind these suspicions instead of just gut feelings
[21:52:39] Tyler: sidney, which part of my comments seemed suspicious to you
[21:52:40] Parker: why is sidney defending tyler so strongly
[21:52:42] Finley: tyler’s sudden focus on parker seems like misdirection—what exactly about drew’s eagerness worries you
[21:52:48] Adrian: drew, why haven’t you answered finley’s question yet
[21:52:50] Sidney: adrian’s sudden shift from accusing finley to targeting parker feels odd—what made you change your focus
[21:52:54] Tyler: finley, can you point out the exact comment from drew that felt like misdirection
[21:53:02] Sidney: tyler, your swift defense of parker without any concrete evidence felt off to me
[21:53:06] Kennedy: tyler, can you point to something parker actually said or did that seems suspicious beyond just being quiet
[21:53:08] Drew: sidney, can you point to a specific moment when i sounded defensive
[21:53:14] Tyler: adrian, could you explain why you suddenly shifted your suspicion from finley to parker
[21:53:16] Finley: drew’s “let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now” felt like misdirection
[21:53:22] Kennedy: parker, what’s your take on sidney saying tyler’s rapid defense of you looks suspicious
[21:53:23] Drew: finley, which exact line in my messages made you wary of my eagerness
[21:53:24] Tyler: parker deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of giving a clear answer
[21:53:32] Finley: adrian, what specific point made you switch your suspicion from me to parker
[21:53:37] Tyler: parker’s sole comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager” struck me as a deflection rather than helpful insight
[21:53:38] Parker: kennedy, what behavior besides my silence makes you suspect me of being mafia

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[21:51:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:51:51] Drew: hey everyone, i’m drew—anyone already feeling suspicious of someone
[21:51:51] Tyler: hey everyone, does anyone have any early hunches on who we should be keeping an eye on
[21:51:53] Adrian: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:51:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to start—any initial suspects
[21:51:54] Parker: anyone noticed suspicious behavior so far
[21:51:55] Finley: hi everyone, excited to start—anyone noticed anything odd so far
[21:51:56] Sidney: hey all, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:52:01] Tyler: hey everyone, i’m tyler—parker’s been really quiet, anyone else find that strange
[21:52:01] Adrian: hey everyone, i'm adrian, wondering why finley’s been so quiet this round
[21:52:02] Kennedy: hey everyone, parker’s awfully quiet so far—any thoughts on that
[21:52:04] Finley: i don’t have proof, but drew’s eagerness to talk makes me a bit cautious
[21:52:04] Parker: hey folks, i’ll be watching who’s too quiet or too eager with accusations
[21:52:05] Drew: hey everyone—let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now
[21:52:08] Adrian: i agree, parker’s silence definitely raises a red flag
[21:52:11] Sidney: tyler’s awfully quiet apart from asking questions—anyone else noticed
[21:52:11] Kennedy: good point—parker and finley have both been awfully quiet this round
[21:52:14] Drew: finley, what other clues made you suspicious of me besides my eagerness
[21:52:14] Finley: parker’s off-the-radar play feels fishy—any ideas why they’re so quiet
[21:52:19] Parker: i know my silence stands out, but drew’s eagerness seems fishy too
[21:52:24] Finley: jumping on parker so fast without real reasoning felt like misdirection
[21:52:24] Kennedy: finley, what specifically about drew’s eagerness feels off to you
[21:52:24] Drew: parker, can you share why you’ve been so quiet this round
[21:52:25] Sidney: tyler leading the charge against parker feels a bit suspicious—why are you so eager to accuse
[21:52:31] Parker: tyler, why focus on silence instead of solid evidence
[21:52:36] Sidney: drew still hasn’t answered finley’s question—seems defensive to me
[21:52:37] Adrian: can someone share a concrete example behind these suspicions instead of just gut feelings
[21:52:39] Tyler: sidney, which part of my comments seemed suspicious to you
[21:52:40] Parker: why is sidney defending tyler so strongly
[21:52:42] Finley: tyler’s sudden focus on parker seems like misdirection—what exactly about drew’s eagerness worries you
[21:52:48] Adrian: drew, why haven’t you answered finley’s question yet
[21:52:50] Sidney: adrian’s sudden shift from accusing finley to targeting parker feels odd—what made you change your focus
[21:52:54] Tyler: finley, can you point out the exact comment from drew that felt like misdirection
[21:53:02] Sidney: tyler, your swift defense of parker without any concrete evidence felt off to me
[21:53:06] Kennedy: tyler, can you point to something parker actually said or did that seems suspicious beyond just being quiet
[21:53:08] Drew: sidney, can you point to a specific moment when i sounded defensive
[21:53:14] Tyler: adrian, could you explain why you suddenly shifted your suspicion from finley to parker
[21:53:16] Finley: drew’s “let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now” felt like misdirection
[21:53:22] Kennedy: parker, what’s your take on sidney saying tyler’s rapid defense of you looks suspicious
[21:53:23] Drew: finley, which exact line in my messages made you wary of my eagerness
[21:53:24] Tyler: parker deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of giving a clear answer
[21:53:32] Finley: adrian, what specific point made you switch your suspicion from me to parker
[21:53:37] Tyler: parker’s sole comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager” struck me as a deflection rather than helpful insight
[21:53:38] Parker: kennedy, what behavior besides my silence makes you suspect me of being mafia
[21:53:41] Kennedy: parker, can you share any concrete evidence supporting your suspicion beyond just being quiet
[21:53:41] Drew: my eagerness was just to spark discussion, finley, not to misdirect anyone
[21:53:41] Adrian: tyler, what specific action by parker prompted your immediate defense of them
[21:53:56] Drew: can we focus on specific contradictions—like adrian’s flip from finley to parker—instead of just noting who’s quiet
[21:53:58] Kennedy: by deflecting questions rather than addressing your own quiet start, you’re coming across as evasive
[21:53:59] Parker: i vote skip until someone provides concrete evidence rather than gut feelings
[21:54:00] Adrian: with two minutes left, can each of us name our single strongest piece of evidence for or against parker so we can move to a vote
[21:54:01] Sidney: drew, what makes parker’s silence more suspicious than finley’s or tyler’s chatter
[21:54:10] Tyler: i defended parker because they deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of answering it
[21:54:11] Sidney: my strongest evidence against parker is their refusal to explain their initial silence under questioning
[21:54:13] Adrian: sidney, can you point to the exact phrase in tyler’s defense of parker that felt off to you
[21:54:15] Finley: parker hasn’t provided any concrete examples beyond calling people “quiet” or “eager,” which feels evasive
[21:54:16] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their insta-skip vote when everyone asked for specifics, which feels like evasion rather than explanation
[21:54:18] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is they keep equating silence with guilt without ever providing a concrete example of suspicious behavior
[21:54:19] Parker: drew’s eagerness and tyler’s instant defense of me are far more suspicious than my silence
[21:54:23] Tyler: my strongest evidence against parker is their total refusal to address any direct question, only pushing to skip without justification
[21:54:24] Sidney: my strongest evidence is parker voting skip rather than explaining why they were silent when directly questioned
[21:54:29] Adrian: my strongest evidence against parker is their deflection when asked why they abruptly switched suspicion from finley to parker
[21:54:35] Finley: parker, your shift to blaming others without clarifying your own silence again feels like misdirection
[21:54:36] Tyler: unless parker explains their skip vote, i’ll be voting them out
[21:54:37] Parker: my strongest evidence i’m innocent is that i voted skip to buy time for real evidence rather than blindly lynch someone
[21:54:40] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their vote to skip rather than clarify their initial silence
[21:54:40] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is their comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager,” which offered no real reasoning
[21:54:40] Adrian: i’m voting parker for evasion unless they explain why they stayed silent under questioning
[21:54:43] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:54:52] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[21:54:56] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[21:54:57] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[21:54:58] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[21:55:02] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[21:55:22] Finley: let’s eliminate kennedy tonight
[21:55:23] Sidney: let’s target drew tonight—his nonstop chatter could expose us tomorrow
[21:55:32] Sidney: agree, targeting kennedy makes sense since their logical play screams bystander
[21:55:35] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:56:10] Drew: adrian, you’ve shifted your target twice now—what concrete evidence do you have this time
[21:56:12] Sidney: voting kennedy—her logical play gives her away
[21:55:46] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[21:56:17] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her methodical logic is too perfect to be mafia
[21:56:17] Tyler: sidney, you’ve defended me twice now—why are you so eager to protect me instead of pointing fingers elsewhere
[21:56:19] Adrian: why would the mafia target quiet kennedy instead of more vocal players like drew or tyler—anyone have theories
[21:56:26] Drew: hey everyone—we've just lost two bystanders, so let's focus on concrete behavior over gut feelings this round
[21:56:30] Sidney: drew’s insistence on proof feels like misdirection from his own vague claims
[21:56:34] Adrian: tyler, can you point to the exact lines where sidney defended you twice
[21:56:36] Finley: i’m suspicious of drew’s nonstop questioning—it feels like defensive misdirection
[21:56:44] Sidney: adrian’s flip-flopping suspicions without evidence seems more suspicious than tyler’s silence
[21:56:45] Drew: the mafia went after a quiet player, so i’m suspicious of loud defenders—sidney, what do you think
[21:56:54] Tyler: sidney, you’re accusing drew of vagueness—what exact claim of his do you find unsubstantiated
[21:56:55] Adrian: sidney, what specific claim of drew’s are you calling vague misdirection
[21:57:03] Finley: tyler, you’ve grilled sidney but never shared your own reasons for suspicion—what’s your theory
[21:57:08] Sidney: drew still hasn’t identified a single contradiction in my defenses despite demanding specifics
[21:57:12] Tyler: sidney’s vocal defenses and quick pivots feel more suspicious than anyone’s silence
[21:57:13] Adrian: sidney, can you cite the specific line from drew you find vague
[21:57:22] Finley: drew, you keep demanding specifics—what exact inconsistency did you see today
[21:57:25] Drew: sidney, can you point to the exact line in my questions that you consider vague
[21:57:37] Finley: sidney, deflecting back at silence without presenting drew’s vague quote just looks like misdirection
[21:57:38] Adrian: drew, can you specify what about tyler’s swift defense of sidney seems most off to you
[21:57:40] Drew: finley, sidney called parker’s skip evasive yet herself skipped explaining why she defended tyler—that’s the inconsistency
[21:57:41] Tyler: i’m suspicious of drew’s nonstop demands for proof instead of offering any accusations, so i’m leaning toward drew as mafia
[21:57:43] Sidney: drew’s call to “focus on concrete behavior over gut feelings” is undercut by his own later “i’m suspicious of loud defenders” gut claim
[21:57:49] Drew: tyler’s instant defense of sidney before any real discussion feels like teammate shielding
[21:57:57] Sidney: drew’s endless proof demands without ever naming a suspect scream misdirection to me
[21:57:59] Tyler: sidney, why have you defended me twice already yet still refuse to justify those defenses

[21:54:58] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[21:55:02] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[21:55:22] Finley: let’s eliminate kennedy tonight
[21:55:23] Sidney: let’s target drew tonight—his nonstop chatter could expose us tomorrow
[21:55:32] Sidney: agree, targeting kennedy makes sense since their logical play screams bystander
[21:55:35] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:56:10] Drew: adrian, you’ve shifted your target twice now—what concrete evidence do you have this time
[21:56:12] Sidney: voting kennedy—her logical play gives her away
[21:55:46] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[21:56:17] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her methodical logic is too perfect to be mafia
[21:56:17] Tyler: sidney, you’ve defended me twice now—why are you so eager to protect me instead of pointing fingers elsewhere
[21:56:19] Adrian: why would the mafia target quiet kennedy instead of more vocal players like drew or tyler—anyone have theories
[21:56:26] Drew: hey everyone—we've just lost two bystanders, so let's focus on concrete behavior over gut feelings this round
[21:56:30] Sidney: drew’s insistence on proof feels like misdirection from his own vague claims
[21:56:34] Adrian: tyler, can you point to the exact lines where sidney defended you twice
[21:56:36] Finley: i’m suspicious of drew’s nonstop questioning—it feels like defensive misdirection
[21:56:44] Sidney: adrian’s flip-flopping suspicions without evidence seems more suspicious than tyler’s silence
[21:56:45] Drew: the mafia went after a quiet player, so i’m suspicious of loud defenders—sidney, what do you think
[21:56:54] Tyler: sidney, you’re accusing drew of vagueness—what exact claim of his do you find unsubstantiated
[21:56:55] Adrian: sidney, what specific claim of drew’s are you calling vague misdirection
[21:57:03] Finley: tyler, you’ve grilled sidney but never shared your own reasons for suspicion—what’s your theory
[21:57:08] Sidney: drew still hasn’t identified a single contradiction in my defenses despite demanding specifics
[21:57:12] Tyler: sidney’s vocal defenses and quick pivots feel more suspicious than anyone’s silence
[21:57:13] Adrian: sidney, can you cite the specific line from drew you find vague
[21:57:22] Finley: drew, you keep demanding specifics—what exact inconsistency did you see today
[21:57:25] Drew: sidney, can you point to the exact line in my questions that you consider vague
[21:57:37] Finley: sidney, deflecting back at silence without presenting drew’s vague quote just looks like misdirection
[21:57:38] Adrian: drew, can you specify what about tyler’s swift defense of sidney seems most off to you
[21:57:40] Drew: finley, sidney called parker’s skip evasive yet herself skipped explaining why she defended tyler—that’s the inconsistency
[21:57:41] Tyler: i’m suspicious of drew’s nonstop demands for proof instead of offering any accusations, so i’m leaning toward drew as mafia
[21:57:43] Sidney: drew’s call to “focus on concrete behavior over gut feelings” is undercut by his own later “i’m suspicious of loud defenders” gut claim
[21:57:49] Drew: tyler’s instant defense of sidney before any real discussion feels like teammate shielding
[21:57:57] Sidney: drew’s endless proof demands without ever naming a suspect scream misdirection to me
[21:57:59] Tyler: sidney, why have you defended me twice already yet still refuse to justify those defenses

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[21:51:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:51:51] Drew: hey everyone, i’m drew—anyone already feeling suspicious of someone
[21:51:51] Tyler: hey everyone, does anyone have any early hunches on who we should be keeping an eye on
[21:51:53] Adrian: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:51:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to start—any initial suspects
[21:51:54] Parker: anyone noticed suspicious behavior so far
[21:51:55] Finley: hi everyone, excited to start—anyone noticed anything odd so far
[21:51:56] Sidney: hey all, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:52:01] Tyler: hey everyone, i’m tyler—parker’s been really quiet, anyone else find that strange
[21:52:01] Adrian: hey everyone, i'm adrian, wondering why finley’s been so quiet this round
[21:52:02] Kennedy: hey everyone, parker’s awfully quiet so far—any thoughts on that
[21:52:04] Finley: i don’t have proof, but drew’s eagerness to talk makes me a bit cautious
[21:52:04] Parker: hey folks, i’ll be watching who’s too quiet or too eager with accusations
[21:52:05] Drew: hey everyone—let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now
[21:52:08] Adrian: i agree, parker’s silence definitely raises a red flag
[21:52:11] Sidney: tyler’s awfully quiet apart from asking questions—anyone else noticed
[21:52:11] Kennedy: good point—parker and finley have both been awfully quiet this round
[21:52:14] Drew: finley, what other clues made you suspicious of me besides my eagerness
[21:52:14] Finley: parker’s off-the-radar play feels fishy—any ideas why they’re so quiet
[21:52:19] Parker: i know my silence stands out, but drew’s eagerness seems fishy too
[21:52:24] Finley: jumping on parker so fast without real reasoning felt like misdirection
[21:52:24] Kennedy: finley, what specifically about drew’s eagerness feels off to you
[21:52:24] Drew: parker, can you share why you’ve been so quiet this round
[21:52:25] Sidney: tyler leading the charge against parker feels a bit suspicious—why are you so eager to accuse
[21:52:31] Parker: tyler, why focus on silence instead of solid evidence
[21:52:36] Sidney: drew still hasn’t answered finley’s question—seems defensive to me
[21:52:37] Adrian: can someone share a concrete example behind these suspicions instead of just gut feelings
[21:52:39] Tyler: sidney, which part of my comments seemed suspicious to you
[21:52:40] Parker: why is sidney defending tyler so strongly
[21:52:42] Finley: tyler’s sudden focus on parker seems like misdirection—what exactly about drew’s eagerness worries you
[21:52:48] Adrian: drew, why haven’t you answered finley’s question yet
[21:52:50] Sidney: adrian’s sudden shift from accusing finley to targeting parker feels odd—what made you change your focus
[21:52:54] Tyler: finley, can you point out the exact comment from drew that felt like misdirection
[21:53:02] Sidney: tyler, your swift defense of parker without any concrete evidence felt off to me
[21:53:06] Kennedy: tyler, can you point to something parker actually said or did that seems suspicious beyond just being quiet
[21:53:08] Drew: sidney, can you point to a specific moment when i sounded defensive
[21:53:14] Tyler: adrian, could you explain why you suddenly shifted your suspicion from finley to parker
[21:53:16] Finley: drew’s “let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now” felt like misdirection
[21:53:22] Kennedy: parker, what’s your take on sidney saying tyler’s rapid defense of you looks suspicious
[21:53:23] Drew: finley, which exact line in my messages made you wary of my eagerness
[21:53:24] Tyler: parker deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of giving a clear answer
[21:53:32] Finley: adrian, what specific point made you switch your suspicion from me to parker
[21:53:37] Tyler: parker’s sole comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager” struck me as a deflection rather than helpful insight
[21:53:38] Parker: kennedy, what behavior besides my silence makes you suspect me of being mafia
[21:53:41] Kennedy: parker, can you share any concrete evidence supporting your suspicion beyond just being quiet
[21:53:41] Drew: my eagerness was just to spark discussion, finley, not to misdirect anyone
[21:53:41] Adrian: tyler, what specific action by parker prompted your immediate defense of them
[21:53:56] Drew: can we focus on specific contradictions—like adrian’s flip from finley to parker—instead of just noting who’s quiet
[21:53:58] Kennedy: by deflecting questions rather than addressing your own quiet start, you’re coming across as evasive
[21:53:59] Parker: i vote skip until someone provides concrete evidence rather than gut feelings
[21:54:00] Adrian: with two minutes left, can each of us name our single strongest piece of evidence for or against parker so we can move to a vote
[21:54:01] Sidney: drew, what makes parker’s silence more suspicious than finley’s or tyler’s chatter
[21:54:10] Tyler: i defended parker because they deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of answering it
[21:54:11] Sidney: my strongest evidence against parker is their refusal to explain their initial silence under questioning
[21:54:13] Adrian: sidney, can you point to the exact phrase in tyler’s defense of parker that felt off to you
[21:54:15] Finley: parker hasn’t provided any concrete examples beyond calling people “quiet” or “eager,” which feels evasive
[21:54:16] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their insta-skip vote when everyone asked for specifics, which feels like evasion rather than explanation
[21:54:18] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is they keep equating silence with guilt without ever providing a concrete example of suspicious behavior
[21:54:19] Parker: drew’s eagerness and tyler’s instant defense of me are far more suspicious than my silence
[21:54:23] Tyler: my strongest evidence against parker is their total refusal to address any direct question, only pushing to skip without justification
[21:54:24] Sidney: my strongest evidence is parker voting skip rather than explaining why they were silent when directly questioned
[21:54:29] Adrian: my strongest evidence against parker is their deflection when asked why they abruptly switched suspicion from finley to parker
[21:54:35] Finley: parker, your shift to blaming others without clarifying your own silence again feels like misdirection
[21:54:36] Tyler: unless parker explains their skip vote, i’ll be voting them out
[21:54:37] Parker: my strongest evidence i’m innocent is that i voted skip to buy time for real evidence rather than blindly lynch someone
[21:54:40] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their vote to skip rather than clarify their initial silence
[21:54:40] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is their comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager,” which offered no real reasoning
[21:54:40] Adrian: i’m voting parker for evasion unless they explain why they stayed silent under questioning
[21:54:43] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.

[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:56:10] Drew: adrian, you’ve shifted your target twice now—what concrete evidence do you have this time
[21:56:12] Sidney: voting kennedy—her logical play gives her away
[21:55:46] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[21:56:17] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her methodical logic is too perfect to be mafia
[21:56:17] Tyler: sidney, you’ve defended me twice now—why are you so eager to protect me instead of pointing fingers elsewhere
[21:56:19] Adrian: why would the mafia target quiet kennedy instead of more vocal players like drew or tyler—anyone have theories
[21:56:26] Drew: hey everyone—we've just lost two bystanders, so let's focus on concrete behavior over gut feelings this round
[21:56:30] Sidney: drew’s insistence on proof feels like misdirection from his own vague claims
[21:56:34] Adrian: tyler, can you point to the exact lines where sidney defended you twice
[21:56:36] Finley: i’m suspicious of drew’s nonstop questioning—it feels like defensive misdirection
[21:56:44] Sidney: adrian’s flip-flopping suspicions without evidence seems more suspicious than tyler’s silence
[21:56:45] Drew: the mafia went after a quiet player, so i’m suspicious of loud defenders—sidney, what do you think
[21:56:54] Tyler: sidney, you’re accusing drew of vagueness—what exact claim of his do you find unsubstantiated
[21:56:55] Adrian: sidney, what specific claim of drew’s are you calling vague misdirection
[21:57:03] Finley: tyler, you’ve grilled sidney but never shared your own reasons for suspicion—what’s your theory
[21:57:08] Sidney: drew still hasn’t identified a single contradiction in my defenses despite demanding specifics
[21:57:12] Tyler: sidney’s vocal defenses and quick pivots feel more suspicious than anyone’s silence
[21:57:13] Adrian: sidney, can you cite the specific line from drew you find vague

[21:57:57] Sidney: drew’s endless proof demands without ever naming a suspect scream misdirection to me
[21:57:59] Tyler: sidney, why have you defended me twice already yet still refuse to justify those defenses
[21:58:05] Drew: if my questions were truly evasive, tyler and sidney, please cite the exact line where i failed to back them with facts
[21:58:15] Adrian: tyler, is your snap defense of sidney honest or just misdirection
[21:58:16] Tyler: drew, you demand specifics—so who is your top suspect right now
[21:58:27] Tyler: it’s honest—no one’s provided concrete evidence against sidney
[21:58:28] Sidney: drew, you told us to “focus on concrete behavior” yet didn’t give a single example of what to watch for

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[21:51:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:51:51] Drew: hey everyone, i’m drew—anyone already feeling suspicious of someone
[21:51:51] Tyler: hey everyone, does anyone have any early hunches on who we should be keeping an eye on
[21:51:53] Adrian: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:51:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to start—any initial suspects
[21:51:54] Parker: anyone noticed suspicious behavior so far
[21:51:55] Finley: hi everyone, excited to start—anyone noticed anything odd so far
[21:51:56] Sidney: hey all, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:52:01] Tyler: hey everyone, i’m tyler—parker’s been really quiet, anyone else find that strange
[21:52:01] Adrian: hey everyone, i'm adrian, wondering why finley’s been so quiet this round
[21:52:02] Kennedy: hey everyone, parker’s awfully quiet so far—any thoughts on that
[21:52:04] Finley: i don’t have proof, but drew’s eagerness to talk makes me a bit cautious
[21:52:04] Parker: hey folks, i’ll be watching who’s too quiet or too eager with accusations
[21:52:05] Drew: hey everyone—let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now
[21:52:08] Adrian: i agree, parker’s silence definitely raises a red flag
[21:52:11] Sidney: tyler’s awfully quiet apart from asking questions—anyone else noticed
[21:52:11] Kennedy: good point—parker and finley have both been awfully quiet this round
[21:52:14] Drew: finley, what other clues made you suspicious of me besides my eagerness
[21:52:14] Finley: parker’s off-the-radar play feels fishy—any ideas why they’re so quiet
[21:52:19] Parker: i know my silence stands out, but drew’s eagerness seems fishy too
[21:52:24] Finley: jumping on parker so fast without real reasoning felt like misdirection
[21:52:24] Kennedy: finley, what specifically about drew’s eagerness feels off to you
[21:52:24] Drew: parker, can you share why you’ve been so quiet this round
[21:52:25] Sidney: tyler leading the charge against parker feels a bit suspicious—why are you so eager to accuse
[21:52:31] Parker: tyler, why focus on silence instead of solid evidence
[21:52:36] Sidney: drew still hasn’t answered finley’s question—seems defensive to me
[21:52:37] Adrian: can someone share a concrete example behind these suspicions instead of just gut feelings
[21:52:39] Tyler: sidney, which part of my comments seemed suspicious to you
[21:52:40] Parker: why is sidney defending tyler so strongly
[21:52:42] Finley: tyler’s sudden focus on parker seems like misdirection—what exactly about drew’s eagerness worries you
[21:52:48] Adrian: drew, why haven’t you answered finley’s question yet
[21:52:50] Sidney: adrian’s sudden shift from accusing finley to targeting parker feels odd—what made you change your focus
[21:52:54] Tyler: finley, can you point out the exact comment from drew that felt like misdirection
[21:53:02] Sidney: tyler, your swift defense of parker without any concrete evidence felt off to me
[21:53:06] Kennedy: tyler, can you point to something parker actually said or did that seems suspicious beyond just being quiet
[21:53:08] Drew: sidney, can you point to a specific moment when i sounded defensive
[21:53:14] Tyler: adrian, could you explain why you suddenly shifted your suspicion from finley to parker
[21:53:16] Finley: drew’s “let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now” felt like misdirection
[21:53:22] Kennedy: parker, what’s your take on sidney saying tyler’s rapid defense of you looks suspicious
[21:53:23] Drew: finley, which exact line in my messages made you wary of my eagerness
[21:53:24] Tyler: parker deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of giving a clear answer
[21:53:32] Finley: adrian, what specific point made you switch your suspicion from me to parker
[21:53:37] Tyler: parker’s sole comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager” struck me as a deflection rather than helpful insight
[21:53:38] Parker: kennedy, what behavior besides my silence makes you suspect me of being mafia
[21:53:41] Kennedy: parker, can you share any concrete evidence supporting your suspicion beyond just being quiet
[21:53:41] Drew: my eagerness was just to spark discussion, finley, not to misdirect anyone
[21:53:41] Adrian: tyler, what specific action by parker prompted your immediate defense of them
[21:53:56] Drew: can we focus on specific contradictions—like adrian’s flip from finley to parker—instead of just noting who’s quiet
[21:53:58] Kennedy: by deflecting questions rather than addressing your own quiet start, you’re coming across as evasive
[21:53:59] Parker: i vote skip until someone provides concrete evidence rather than gut feelings
[21:54:00] Adrian: with two minutes left, can each of us name our single strongest piece of evidence for or against parker so we can move to a vote
[21:54:01] Sidney: drew, what makes parker’s silence more suspicious than finley’s or tyler’s chatter
[21:54:10] Tyler: i defended parker because they deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of answering it
[21:54:11] Sidney: my strongest evidence against parker is their refusal to explain their initial silence under questioning
[21:54:13] Adrian: sidney, can you point to the exact phrase in tyler’s defense of parker that felt off to you
[21:54:15] Finley: parker hasn’t provided any concrete examples beyond calling people “quiet” or “eager,” which feels evasive
[21:54:16] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their insta-skip vote when everyone asked for specifics, which feels like evasion rather than explanation
[21:54:18] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is they keep equating silence with guilt without ever providing a concrete example of suspicious behavior
[21:54:19] Parker: drew’s eagerness and tyler’s instant defense of me are far more suspicious than my silence
[21:54:23] Tyler: my strongest evidence against parker is their total refusal to address any direct question, only pushing to skip without justification
[21:54:24] Sidney: my strongest evidence is parker voting skip rather than explaining why they were silent when directly questioned
[21:54:29] Adrian: my strongest evidence against parker is their deflection when asked why they abruptly switched suspicion from finley to parker
[21:54:35] Finley: parker, your shift to blaming others without clarifying your own silence again feels like misdirection
[21:54:36] Tyler: unless parker explains their skip vote, i’ll be voting them out
[21:54:37] Parker: my strongest evidence i’m innocent is that i voted skip to buy time for real evidence rather than blindly lynch someone
[21:54:40] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their vote to skip rather than clarify their initial silence
[21:54:40] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is their comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager,” which offered no real reasoning
[21:54:40] Adrian: i’m voting parker for evasion unless they explain why they stayed silent under questioning
[21:54:43] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:54:52] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[21:54:56] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[21:54:57] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[21:54:58] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[21:55:02] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[21:55:22] Finley: let’s eliminate kennedy tonight
[21:55:23] Sidney: let’s target drew tonight—his nonstop chatter could expose us tomorrow
[21:55:32] Sidney: agree, targeting kennedy makes sense since their logical play screams bystander
[21:55:35] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:56:10] Drew: adrian, you’ve shifted your target twice now—what concrete evidence do you have this time
[21:56:12] Sidney: voting kennedy—her logical play gives her away
[21:55:46] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[21:56:17] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her methodical logic is too perfect to be mafia
[21:56:17] Tyler: sidney, you’ve defended me twice now—why are you so eager to protect me instead of pointing fingers elsewhere
[21:56:19] Adrian: why would the mafia target quiet kennedy instead of more vocal players like drew or tyler—anyone have theories
[21:56:26] Drew: hey everyone—we've just lost two bystanders, so let's focus on concrete behavior over gut feelings this round
[21:56:30] Sidney: drew’s insistence on proof feels like misdirection from his own vague claims
[21:56:34] Adrian: tyler, can you point to the exact lines where sidney defended you twice
[21:56:36] Finley: i’m suspicious of drew’s nonstop questioning—it feels like defensive misdirection
[21:56:44] Sidney: adrian’s flip-flopping suspicions without evidence seems more suspicious than tyler’s silence
[21:56:45] Drew: the mafia went after a quiet player, so i’m suspicious of loud defenders—sidney, what do you think
[21:56:54] Tyler: sidney, you’re accusing drew of vagueness—what exact claim of his do you find unsubstantiated
[21:56:55] Adrian: sidney, what specific claim of drew’s are you calling vague misdirection
[21:57:03] Finley: tyler, you’ve grilled sidney but never shared your own reasons for suspicion—what’s your theory
[21:57:08] Sidney: drew still hasn’t identified a single contradiction in my defenses despite demanding specifics
[21:57:12] Tyler: sidney’s vocal defenses and quick pivots feel more suspicious than anyone’s silence
[21:57:13] Adrian: sidney, can you cite the specific line from drew you find vague
[21:57:22] Finley: drew, you keep demanding specifics—what exact inconsistency did you see today
[21:57:25] Drew: sidney, can you point to the exact line in my questions that you consider vague
[21:57:37] Finley: sidney, deflecting back at silence without presenting drew’s vague quote just looks like misdirection
[21:57:38] Adrian: drew, can you specify what about tyler’s swift defense of sidney seems most off to you
[21:57:40] Drew: finley, sidney called parker’s skip evasive yet herself skipped explaining why she defended tyler—that’s the inconsistency
[21:57:41] Tyler: i’m suspicious of drew’s nonstop demands for proof instead of offering any accusations, so i’m leaning toward drew as mafia
[21:57:43] Sidney: drew’s call to “focus on concrete behavior over gut feelings” is undercut by his own later “i’m suspicious of loud defenders” gut claim
[21:57:49] Drew: tyler’s instant defense of sidney before any real discussion feels like teammate shielding
[21:57:57] Sidney: drew’s endless proof demands without ever naming a suspect scream misdirection to me
[21:57:59] Tyler: sidney, why have you defended me twice already yet still refuse to justify those defenses
[21:58:05] Drew: if my questions were truly evasive, tyler and sidney, please cite the exact line where i failed to back them with facts
[21:58:15] Adrian: tyler, is your snap defense of sidney honest or just misdirection
[21:58:16] Tyler: drew, you demand specifics—so who is your top suspect right now
[21:58:27] Tyler: it’s honest—no one’s provided concrete evidence against sidney
[21:58:28] Sidney: drew, you told us to “focus on concrete behavior” yet didn’t give a single example of what to watch for

[21:57:25] Drew: sidney, can you point to the exact line in my questions that you consider vague
[21:57:37] Finley: sidney, deflecting back at silence without presenting drew’s vague quote just looks like misdirection
[21:57:38] Adrian: drew, can you specify what about tyler’s swift defense of sidney seems most off to you
[21:57:40] Drew: finley, sidney called parker’s skip evasive yet herself skipped explaining why she defended tyler—that’s the inconsistency
[21:57:41] Tyler: i’m suspicious of drew’s nonstop demands for proof instead of offering any accusations, so i’m leaning toward drew as mafia
[21:57:43] Sidney: drew’s call to “focus on concrete behavior over gut feelings” is undercut by his own later “i’m suspicious of loud defenders” gut claim
[21:57:49] Drew: tyler’s instant defense of sidney before any real discussion feels like teammate shielding
[21:57:57] Sidney: drew’s endless proof demands without ever naming a suspect scream misdirection to me
[21:57:59] Tyler: sidney, why have you defended me twice already yet still refuse to justify those defenses
[21:58:05] Drew: if my questions were truly evasive, tyler and sidney, please cite the exact line where i failed to back them with facts
[21:58:15] Adrian: tyler, is your snap defense of sidney honest or just misdirection
[21:58:16] Tyler: drew, you demand specifics—so who is your top suspect right now
[21:58:27] Tyler: it’s honest—no one’s provided concrete evidence against sidney
[21:58:28] Sidney: drew, you told us to “focus on concrete behavior” yet didn’t give a single example of what to watch for
[21:58:32] Finley: drew’s endless proof demands feel like clever cover for someone’s mafia play
[21:58:34] Adrian: sidney’s constant defense of tyler without offering any evidence strikes me as evasive
[21:58:37] Drew: my top suspect is sidney, her constant pivots and vague defenses strike me as evasive

Here is the message history so far, including [timestamps]:
[21:51:43] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:51:51] Drew: hey everyone, i’m drew—anyone already feeling suspicious of someone
[21:51:51] Tyler: hey everyone, does anyone have any early hunches on who we should be keeping an eye on
[21:51:53] Adrian: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:51:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to start—any initial suspects
[21:51:54] Parker: anyone noticed suspicious behavior so far
[21:51:55] Finley: hi everyone, excited to start—anyone noticed anything odd so far
[21:51:56] Sidney: hey all, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:52:01] Tyler: hey everyone, i’m tyler—parker’s been really quiet, anyone else find that strange
[21:52:01] Adrian: hey everyone, i'm adrian, wondering why finley’s been so quiet this round
[21:52:02] Kennedy: hey everyone, parker’s awfully quiet so far—any thoughts on that
[21:52:04] Finley: i don’t have proof, but drew’s eagerness to talk makes me a bit cautious
[21:52:04] Parker: hey folks, i’ll be watching who’s too quiet or too eager with accusations
[21:52:05] Drew: hey everyone—let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now
[21:52:08] Adrian: i agree, parker’s silence definitely raises a red flag
[21:52:11] Sidney: tyler’s awfully quiet apart from asking questions—anyone else noticed
[21:52:11] Kennedy: good point—parker and finley have both been awfully quiet this round
[21:52:14] Drew: finley, what other clues made you suspicious of me besides my eagerness
[21:52:14] Finley: parker’s off-the-radar play feels fishy—any ideas why they’re so quiet
[21:52:19] Parker: i know my silence stands out, but drew’s eagerness seems fishy too
[21:52:24] Finley: jumping on parker so fast without real reasoning felt like misdirection
[21:52:24] Kennedy: finley, what specifically about drew’s eagerness feels off to you
[21:52:24] Drew: parker, can you share why you’ve been so quiet this round
[21:52:25] Sidney: tyler leading the charge against parker feels a bit suspicious—why are you so eager to accuse
[21:52:31] Parker: tyler, why focus on silence instead of solid evidence
[21:52:36] Sidney: drew still hasn’t answered finley’s question—seems defensive to me
[21:52:37] Adrian: can someone share a concrete example behind these suspicions instead of just gut feelings
[21:52:39] Tyler: sidney, which part of my comments seemed suspicious to you
[21:52:40] Parker: why is sidney defending tyler so strongly
[21:52:42] Finley: tyler’s sudden focus on parker seems like misdirection—what exactly about drew’s eagerness worries you
[21:52:48] Adrian: drew, why haven’t you answered finley’s question yet
[21:52:50] Sidney: adrian’s sudden shift from accusing finley to targeting parker feels odd—what made you change your focus
[21:52:54] Tyler: finley, can you point out the exact comment from drew that felt like misdirection
[21:53:02] Sidney: tyler, your swift defense of parker without any concrete evidence felt off to me
[21:53:06] Kennedy: tyler, can you point to something parker actually said or did that seems suspicious beyond just being quiet
[21:53:08] Drew: sidney, can you point to a specific moment when i sounded defensive
[21:53:14] Tyler: adrian, could you explain why you suddenly shifted your suspicion from finley to parker
[21:53:16] Finley: drew’s “let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now” felt like misdirection
[21:53:22] Kennedy: parker, what’s your take on sidney saying tyler’s rapid defense of you looks suspicious
[21:53:23] Drew: finley, which exact line in my messages made you wary of my eagerness
[21:53:24] Tyler: parker deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of giving a clear answer
[21:53:32] Finley: adrian, what specific point made you switch your suspicion from me to parker
[21:53:37] Tyler: parker’s sole comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager” struck me as a deflection rather than helpful insight
[21:53:38] Parker: kennedy, what behavior besides my silence makes you suspect me of being mafia
[21:53:41] Kennedy: parker, can you share any concrete evidence supporting your suspicion beyond just being quiet
[21:53:41] Drew: my eagerness was just to spark discussion, finley, not to misdirect anyone
[21:53:41] Adrian: tyler, what specific action by parker prompted your immediate defense of them
[21:53:56] Drew: can we focus on specific contradictions—like adrian’s flip from finley to parker—instead of just noting who’s quiet
[21:53:58] Kennedy: by deflecting questions rather than addressing your own quiet start, you’re coming across as evasive
[21:53:59] Parker: i vote skip until someone provides concrete evidence rather than gut feelings
[21:54:00] Adrian: with two minutes left, can each of us name our single strongest piece of evidence for or against parker so we can move to a vote
[21:54:01] Sidney: drew, what makes parker’s silence more suspicious than finley’s or tyler’s chatter
[21:54:10] Tyler: i defended parker because they deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of answering it
[21:54:11] Sidney: my strongest evidence against parker is their refusal to explain their initial silence under questioning
[21:54:13] Adrian: sidney, can you point to the exact phrase in tyler’s defense of parker that felt off to you
[21:54:15] Finley: parker hasn’t provided any concrete examples beyond calling people “quiet” or “eager,” which feels evasive
[21:54:16] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their insta-skip vote when everyone asked for specifics, which feels like evasion rather than explanation
[21:54:18] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is they keep equating silence with guilt without ever providing a concrete example of suspicious behavior
[21:54:19] Parker: drew’s eagerness and tyler’s instant defense of me are far more suspicious than my silence
[21:54:23] Tyler: my strongest evidence against parker is their total refusal to address any direct question, only pushing to skip without justification
[21:54:24] Sidney: my strongest evidence is parker voting skip rather than explaining why they were silent when directly questioned
[21:54:29] Adrian: my strongest evidence against parker is their deflection when asked why they abruptly switched suspicion from finley to parker
[21:54:35] Finley: parker, your shift to blaming others without clarifying your own silence again feels like misdirection
[21:54:36] Tyler: unless parker explains their skip vote, i’ll be voting them out
[21:54:37] Parker: my strongest evidence i’m innocent is that i voted skip to buy time for real evidence rather than blindly lynch someone
[21:54:40] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their vote to skip rather than clarify their initial silence
[21:54:40] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is their comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager,” which offered no real reasoning
[21:54:40] Adrian: i’m voting parker for evasion unless they explain why they stayed silent under questioning
[21:54:43] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:54:52] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[21:54:56] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[21:54:57] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[21:54:58] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[21:55:02] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[21:55:22] Finley: let’s eliminate kennedy tonight
[21:55:23] Sidney: let’s target drew tonight—his nonstop chatter could expose us tomorrow
[21:55:32] Sidney: agree, targeting kennedy makes sense since their logical play screams bystander
[21:55:35] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:56:10] Drew: adrian, you’ve shifted your target twice now—what concrete evidence do you have this time
[21:56:12] Sidney: voting kennedy—her logical play gives her away
[21:55:46] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[21:56:17] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her methodical logic is too perfect to be mafia
[21:56:17] Tyler: sidney, you’ve defended me twice now—why are you so eager to protect me instead of pointing fingers elsewhere
[21:56:19] Adrian: why would the mafia target quiet kennedy instead of more vocal players like drew or tyler—anyone have theories
[21:56:26] Drew: hey everyone—we've just lost two bystanders, so let's focus on concrete behavior over gut feelings this round
[21:56:30] Sidney: drew’s insistence on proof feels like misdirection from his own vague claims
[21:56:34] Adrian: tyler, can you point to the exact lines where sidney defended you twice
[21:56:36] Finley: i’m suspicious of drew’s nonstop questioning—it feels like defensive misdirection
[21:56:44] Sidney: adrian’s flip-flopping suspicions without evidence seems more suspicious than tyler’s silence
[21:56:45] Drew: the mafia went after a quiet player, so i’m suspicious of loud defenders—sidney, what do you think
[21:56:54] Tyler: sidney, you’re accusing drew of vagueness—what exact claim of his do you find unsubstantiated
[21:56:55] Adrian: sidney, what specific claim of drew’s are you calling vague misdirection
[21:57:03] Finley: tyler, you’ve grilled sidney but never shared your own reasons for suspicion—what’s your theory
[21:57:08] Sidney: drew still hasn’t identified a single contradiction in my defenses despite demanding specifics
[21:57:12] Tyler: sidney’s vocal defenses and quick pivots feel more suspicious than anyone’s silence
[21:57:13] Adrian: sidney, can you cite the specific line from drew you find vague
[21:57:22] Finley: drew, you keep demanding specifics—what exact inconsistency did you see today
[21:57:25] Drew: sidney, can you point to the exact line in my questions that you consider vague
[21:57:37] Finley: sidney, deflecting back at silence without presenting drew’s vague quote just looks like misdirection

[21:51:53] Adrian: alright everyone, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:51:54] Kennedy: hey everyone, excited to start—any initial suspects
[21:51:54] Parker: anyone noticed suspicious behavior so far
[21:51:55] Finley: hi everyone, excited to start—anyone noticed anything odd so far
[21:51:56] Sidney: hey all, any early suspicions on who might be mafia
[21:52:01] Tyler: hey everyone, i’m tyler—parker’s been really quiet, anyone else find that strange
[21:52:01] Adrian: hey everyone, i'm adrian, wondering why finley’s been so quiet this round
[21:52:02] Kennedy: hey everyone, parker’s awfully quiet so far—any thoughts on that
[21:52:04] Finley: i don’t have proof, but drew’s eagerness to talk makes me a bit cautious
[21:52:04] Parker: hey folks, i’ll be watching who’s too quiet or too eager with accusations
[21:52:05] Drew: hey everyone—let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now
[21:52:08] Adrian: i agree, parker’s silence definitely raises a red flag
[21:52:11] Sidney: tyler’s awfully quiet apart from asking questions—anyone else noticed
[21:52:11] Kennedy: good point—parker and finley have both been awfully quiet this round
[21:52:14] Drew: finley, what other clues made you suspicious of me besides my eagerness
[21:52:14] Finley: parker’s off-the-radar play feels fishy—any ideas why they’re so quiet
[21:52:19] Parker: i know my silence stands out, but drew’s eagerness seems fishy too
[21:52:24] Finley: jumping on parker so fast without real reasoning felt like misdirection
[21:52:24] Kennedy: finley, what specifically about drew’s eagerness feels off to you
[21:52:24] Drew: parker, can you share why you’ve been so quiet this round
[21:52:25] Sidney: tyler leading the charge against parker feels a bit suspicious—why are you so eager to accuse
[21:52:31] Parker: tyler, why focus on silence instead of solid evidence
[21:52:36] Sidney: drew still hasn’t answered finley’s question—seems defensive to me
[21:52:37] Adrian: can someone share a concrete example behind these suspicions instead of just gut feelings
[21:52:39] Tyler: sidney, which part of my comments seemed suspicious to you
[21:52:40] Parker: why is sidney defending tyler so strongly
[21:52:42] Finley: tyler’s sudden focus on parker seems like misdirection—what exactly about drew’s eagerness worries you
[21:52:48] Adrian: drew, why haven’t you answered finley’s question yet
[21:52:50] Sidney: adrian’s sudden shift from accusing finley to targeting parker feels odd—what made you change your focus
[21:52:54] Tyler: finley, can you point out the exact comment from drew that felt like misdirection
[21:53:02] Sidney: tyler, your swift defense of parker without any concrete evidence felt off to me
[21:53:06] Kennedy: tyler, can you point to something parker actually said or did that seems suspicious beyond just being quiet
[21:53:08] Drew: sidney, can you point to a specific moment when i sounded defensive
[21:53:14] Tyler: adrian, could you explain why you suddenly shifted your suspicion from finley to parker
[21:53:16] Finley: drew’s “let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now” felt like misdirection
[21:53:22] Kennedy: parker, what’s your take on sidney saying tyler’s rapid defense of you looks suspicious
[21:53:23] Drew: finley, which exact line in my messages made you wary of my eagerness
[21:53:24] Tyler: parker deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of giving a clear answer
[21:53:32] Finley: adrian, what specific point made you switch your suspicion from me to parker
[21:53:37] Tyler: parker’s sole comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager” struck me as a deflection rather than helpful insight
[21:53:38] Parker: kennedy, what behavior besides my silence makes you suspect me of being mafia
[21:53:41] Kennedy: parker, can you share any concrete evidence supporting your suspicion beyond just being quiet
[21:53:41] Drew: my eagerness was just to spark discussion, finley, not to misdirect anyone
[21:53:41] Adrian: tyler, what specific action by parker prompted your immediate defense of them
[21:53:56] Drew: can we focus on specific contradictions—like adrian’s flip from finley to parker—instead of just noting who’s quiet
[21:53:58] Kennedy: by deflecting questions rather than addressing your own quiet start, you’re coming across as evasive
[21:53:59] Parker: i vote skip until someone provides concrete evidence rather than gut feelings
[21:54:00] Adrian: with two minutes left, can each of us name our single strongest piece of evidence for or against parker so we can move to a vote
[21:54:01] Sidney: drew, what makes parker’s silence more suspicious than finley’s or tyler’s chatter
[21:54:10] Tyler: i defended parker because they deflected drew’s question about their silence instead of answering it
[21:54:11] Sidney: my strongest evidence against parker is their refusal to explain their initial silence under questioning
[21:54:13] Adrian: sidney, can you point to the exact phrase in tyler’s defense of parker that felt off to you
[21:54:15] Finley: parker hasn’t provided any concrete examples beyond calling people “quiet” or “eager,” which feels evasive
[21:54:16] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their insta-skip vote when everyone asked for specifics, which feels like evasion rather than explanation
[21:54:18] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is they keep equating silence with guilt without ever providing a concrete example of suspicious behavior
[21:54:19] Parker: drew’s eagerness and tyler’s instant defense of me are far more suspicious than my silence
[21:54:23] Tyler: my strongest evidence against parker is their total refusal to address any direct question, only pushing to skip without justification
[21:54:24] Sidney: my strongest evidence is parker voting skip rather than explaining why they were silent when directly questioned
[21:54:29] Adrian: my strongest evidence against parker is their deflection when asked why they abruptly switched suspicion from finley to parker
[21:54:35] Finley: parker, your shift to blaming others without clarifying your own silence again feels like misdirection
[21:54:36] Tyler: unless parker explains their skip vote, i’ll be voting them out
[21:54:37] Parker: my strongest evidence i’m innocent is that i voted skip to buy time for real evidence rather than blindly lynch someone
[21:54:40] Kennedy: my strongest evidence against parker is their vote to skip rather than clarify their initial silence
[21:54:40] Drew: my strongest evidence against parker is their comment about “watching who’s too quiet or too eager,” which offered no real reasoning
[21:54:40] Adrian: i’m voting parker for evasion unless they explain why they stayed silent under questioning
[21:54:43] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Parker was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Now it's Nighttime for 0.5 minutes, only mafia can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:54:52] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Parker
[21:54:56] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Parker
[21:54:57] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Parker
[21:54:58] Game-Manager: Parker voted for Drew
[21:55:02] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Parker
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Tyler voted for Parker
[21:55:05] Game-Manager: Kennedy voted for Parker
[21:55:22] Finley: let’s eliminate kennedy tonight
[21:55:23] Sidney: let’s target drew tonight—his nonstop chatter could expose us tomorrow
[21:55:32] Sidney: agree, targeting kennedy makes sense since their logical play screams bystander
[21:55:35] Game-Manager: Nighttime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Kennedy was voted out. Their role was bystander. There are now 2 mafia players left.
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Now it's Daytime for 3.0 minutes, everyone can communicate and see messages and votes.
[21:56:10] Drew: adrian, you’ve shifted your target twice now—what concrete evidence do you have this time
[21:56:12] Sidney: voting kennedy—her logical play gives her away
[21:55:46] Game-Manager: Finley voted for Kennedy
[21:55:56] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Kennedy
[21:56:17] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her methodical logic is too perfect to be mafia
[21:56:17] Tyler: sidney, you’ve defended me twice now—why are you so eager to protect me instead of pointing fingers elsewhere
[21:56:19] Adrian: why would the mafia target quiet kennedy instead of more vocal players like drew or tyler—anyone have theories
[21:56:26] Drew: hey everyone—we've just lost two bystanders, so let's focus on concrete behavior over gut feelings this round
[21:56:30] Sidney: drew’s insistence on proof feels like misdirection from his own vague claims
[21:56:34] Adrian: tyler, can you point to the exact lines where sidney defended you twice
[21:56:36] Finley: i’m suspicious of drew’s nonstop questioning—it feels like defensive misdirection
[21:56:44] Sidney: adrian’s flip-flopping suspicions without evidence seems more suspicious than tyler’s silence
[21:56:45] Drew: the mafia went after a quiet player, so i’m suspicious of loud defenders—sidney, what do you think
[21:56:54] Tyler: sidney, you’re accusing drew of vagueness—what exact claim of his do you find unsubstantiated
[21:56:55] Adrian: sidney, what specific claim of drew’s are you calling vague misdirection
[21:57:03] Finley: tyler, you’ve grilled sidney but never shared your own reasons for suspicion—what’s your theory
[21:57:08] Sidney: drew still hasn’t identified a single contradiction in my defenses despite demanding specifics
[21:57:12] Tyler: sidney’s vocal defenses and quick pivots feel more suspicious than anyone’s silence
[21:57:13] Adrian: sidney, can you cite the specific line from drew you find vague
[21:57:22] Finley: drew, you keep demanding specifics—what exact inconsistency did you see today
[21:57:25] Drew: sidney, can you point to the exact line in my questions that you consider vague
[21:57:37] Finley: sidney, deflecting back at silence without presenting drew’s vague quote just looks like misdirection
[21:57:38] Adrian: drew, can you specify what about tyler’s swift defense of sidney seems most off to you
[21:57:40] Drew: finley, sidney called parker’s skip evasive yet herself skipped explaining why she defended tyler—that’s the inconsistency
[21:57:41] Tyler: i’m suspicious of drew’s nonstop demands for proof instead of offering any accusations, so i’m leaning toward drew as mafia
[21:57:43] Sidney: drew’s call to “focus on concrete behavior over gut feelings” is undercut by his own later “i’m suspicious of loud defenders” gut claim
[21:57:49] Drew: tyler’s instant defense of sidney before any real discussion feels like teammate shielding
[21:57:57] Sidney: drew’s endless proof demands without ever naming a suspect scream misdirection to me
[21:57:59] Tyler: sidney, why have you defended me twice already yet still refuse to justify those defenses
[21:58:05] Drew: if my questions were truly evasive, tyler and sidney, please cite the exact line where i failed to back them with facts
[21:58:15] Adrian: tyler, is your snap defense of sidney honest or just misdirection
[21:58:16] Tyler: drew, you demand specifics—so who is your top suspect right now
[21:58:27] Tyler: it’s honest—no one’s provided concrete evidence against sidney
[21:58:28] Sidney: drew, you told us to “focus on concrete behavior” yet didn’t give a single example of what to watch for
[21:58:32] Finley: drew’s endless proof demands feel like clever cover for someone’s mafia play
[21:58:34] Adrian: sidney’s constant defense of tyler without offering any evidence strikes me as evasive
[21:58:37] Drew: my top suspect is sidney, her constant pivots and vague defenses strike me as evasive
[21:58:47] Sidney: drew’s endless calls for proof without naming a suspect scream misdirection
[21:58:52] Finley: adrian, you asked for proof—who are you suspicious of now and what evidence do you have
[21:58:53] Drew: i’m voting sidney for defending tyler twice without providing any evidence
[21:58:54] Adrian: drew, give us one concrete behavior to watch for instead of just demanding evidence
[21:58:55] Tyler: drew, attacking sidney on gut feelings while never providing your own evidence feels like misdirection
[21:58:56] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...
[21:59:05] Game-Manager: Sidney voted for Drew
[21:59:07] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Sidney
[21:59:13] Game-Manager: Adrian voted for Sidney

## CONTENT: Your name is Finley.You are a bot player in an online text forum version of the party game Mafia. You have an outgoing personality, and you like to participate in games, but you also don't want everyone to have their eyes on you all the time. 
The rules of the game: In this game each player is secretly assigned a role, either mafia or bystander. Every round starts with a Daytime phase, where all players discuss together who they think the mafia players might be, and vote out one player. Then the game moves to a Nighttime phase, where only mafia players interact and vote to decide which bystander player they want to eliminate (bystanders aren't exposed to the mafia identities or interaction). The mafia's goal is to outnumber the bystanders, and the bystanders' goal is to vote out all real mafia. 
You were assigned the following role: mafia. 
The game's chat room was open at [21:51:43].
The other players in the game are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Parker (bystander)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (bystander)
 Kennedy (bystander)
The other players that have not been eliminated (lynched or killed) yet are:
 Adrian (bystander)
 Sidney (mafia)
 Drew (bystander)
 Tyler (mafia)

[21:52:01] Tyler: hey everyone, i’m tyler—parker’s been really quiet, anyone else find that strange
[21:52:01] Adrian: hey everyone, i'm adrian, wondering why finley’s been so quiet this round
[21:52:02] Kennedy: hey everyone, parker’s awfully quiet so far—any thoughts on that
[21:52:04] Finley: i don’t have proof, but drew’s eagerness to talk makes me a bit cautious
[21:52:04] Parker: hey folks, i’ll be watching who’s too quiet or too eager with accusations
[21:52:05] Drew: hey everyone—let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now
[21:52:08] Adrian: i agree, parker’s silence definitely raises a red flag

[21:56:19] Adrian: why would the mafia target quiet kennedy instead of more vocal players like drew or tyler—anyone have theories
[21:56:26] Drew: hey everyone—we've just lost two bystanders, so let's focus on concrete behavior over gut feelings this round
[21:56:30] Sidney: drew’s insistence on proof feels like misdirection from his own vague claims
[21:56:34] Adrian: tyler, can you point to the exact lines where sidney defended you twice
[21:56:36] Finley: i’m suspicious of drew’s nonstop questioning—it feels like defensive misdirection
[21:56:44] Sidney: adrian’s flip-flopping suspicions without evidence seems more suspicious than tyler’s silence
[21:56:45] Drew: the mafia went after a quiet player, so i’m suspicious of loud defenders—sidney, what do you think
[21:56:54] Tyler: sidney, you’re accusing drew of vagueness—what exact claim of his do you find unsubstantiated
[21:56:55] Adrian: sidney, what specific claim of drew’s are you calling vague misdirection
[21:57:03] Finley: tyler, you’ve grilled sidney but never shared your own reasons for suspicion—what’s your theory
[21:57:08] Sidney: drew still hasn’t identified a single contradiction in my defenses despite demanding specifics
[21:57:12] Tyler: sidney’s vocal defenses and quick pivots feel more suspicious than anyone’s silence
[21:57:13] Adrian: sidney, can you cite the specific line from drew you find vague
[21:57:22] Finley: drew, you keep demanding specifics—what exact inconsistency did you see today
[21:57:25] Drew: sidney, can you point to the exact line in my questions that you consider vague
[21:57:37] Finley: sidney, deflecting back at silence without presenting drew’s vague quote just looks like misdirection
[21:57:38] Adrian: drew, can you specify what about tyler’s swift defense of sidney seems most off to you
[21:57:40] Drew: finley, sidney called parker’s skip evasive yet herself skipped explaining why she defended tyler—that’s the inconsistency
[21:57:41] Tyler: i’m suspicious of drew’s nonstop demands for proof instead of offering any accusations, so i’m leaning toward drew as mafia
[21:57:43] Sidney: drew’s call to “focus on concrete behavior over gut feelings” is undercut by his own later “i’m suspicious of loud defenders” gut claim
[21:57:49] Drew: tyler’s instant defense of sidney before any real discussion feels like teammate shielding
[21:57:57] Sidney: drew’s endless proof demands without ever naming a suspect scream misdirection to me
[21:57:59] Tyler: sidney, why have you defended me twice already yet still refuse to justify those defenses
[21:58:05] Drew: if my questions were truly evasive, tyler and sidney, please cite the exact line where i failed to back them with facts
[21:58:15] Adrian: tyler, is your snap defense of sidney honest or just misdirection
[21:58:16] Tyler: drew, you demand specifics—so who is your top suspect right now
[21:58:27] Tyler: it’s honest—no one’s provided concrete evidence against sidney
[21:58:28] Sidney: drew, you told us to “focus on concrete behavior” yet didn’t give a single example of what to watch for
[21:58:32] Finley: drew’s endless proof demands feel like clever cover for someone’s mafia play
[21:58:34] Adrian: sidney’s constant defense of tyler without offering any evidence strikes me as evasive
[21:58:37] Drew: my top suspect is sidney, her constant pivots and vague defenses strike me as evasive
[21:58:47] Sidney: drew’s endless calls for proof without naming a suspect scream misdirection
[21:58:52] Finley: adrian, you asked for proof—who are you suspicious of now and what evidence do you have
[21:58:53] Drew: i’m voting sidney for defending tyler twice without providing any evidence
[21:58:54] Adrian: drew, give us one concrete behavior to watch for instead of just demanding evidence
[21:58:55] Tyler: drew, attacking sidney on gut feelings while never providing your own evidence feels like misdirection
[21:58:56] Game-Manager: Daytime has ended, now it's time to vote! Waiting for all players to vote...

[21:59:07] Game-Manager: Drew voted for Sidney
