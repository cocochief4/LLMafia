[21:51:55] Finley: hi everyone, excited to start—anyone noticed anything odd so far
[21:52:04] Finley: i don’t have proof, but drew’s eagerness to talk makes me a bit cautious
[21:52:14] Finley: parker’s off-the-radar play feels fishy—any ideas why they’re so quiet
[21:52:24] Finley: jumping on parker so fast without real reasoning felt like misdirection
[21:52:42] Finley: tyler’s sudden focus on parker seems like misdirection—what exactly about drew’s eagerness worries you
[21:53:16] Finley: drew’s “let’s kick things off: who’s most suspicious right now” felt like misdirection
[21:53:32] Finley: adrian, what specific point made you switch your suspicion from me to parker
[21:54:15] Finley: parker hasn’t provided any concrete examples beyond calling people “quiet” or “eager,” which feels evasive
[21:54:35] Finley: parker, your shift to blaming others without clarifying your own silence again feels like misdirection
[21:55:22] Finley: let’s eliminate kennedy tonight
[21:56:17] Finley: i’m voting kennedy—her methodical logic is too perfect to be mafia
[21:56:36] Finley: i’m suspicious of drew’s nonstop questioning—it feels like defensive misdirection
[21:57:03] Finley: tyler, you’ve grilled sidney but never shared your own reasons for suspicion—what’s your theory
[21:57:22] Finley: drew, you keep demanding specifics—what exact inconsistency did you see today
[21:57:37] Finley: sidney, deflecting back at silence without presenting drew’s vague quote just looks like misdirection
[21:58:32] Finley: drew’s endless proof demands feel like clever cover for someone’s mafia play
[21:58:52] Finley: adrian, you asked for proof—who are you suspicious of now and what evidence do you have
