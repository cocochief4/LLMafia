[13:43:59] Emerson: not really
[13:44:05] Ari: we havent heard much from emerson since hello
[13:44:07] Emerson: who is alex? he is not in the game?
[13:44:09] Addison: sam jumps to conclusions too fast
[13:44:09] Frankie: maybe alex just stepped away for coffee

[13:44:37] Ari: nobody named alex here sounds like a distraction move
[13:44:40] Ronny: sam it would help to know why you seem off
[13:44:42] Emerson: Possibly
[13:44:52] Addison: anyone else find it weird that people keep talking about alex
