[13:43:57] Ronny: seems like alex isnt chiming in today
[13:44:12] Ronny: id say emerson hasnt been super chatty either
[13:44:28] Ronny: emerson you have been quiet too what do you think
[13:44:40] Ronny: sam it would help to know why you seem off
[13:44:54] Ronny: lets drop the alex distraction and focus on real chat contributions
[13:46:11] Ronny: frankie can you explain why you voted for emerson
[13:46:23] Ronny: lets keep an eye on ari and frankie
[13:46:49] Ronny: we should slow down and point out actual odd behavior instead of random names
[13:47:02] Ronny: frankie i need to hear your reasons for accusing me
[13:47:21] Ronny: i got suspicious of frankie for focusing on me instead of pointing out clear odd actions
[13:47:54] Ronny: voting frankie since their reasons feel shallow
