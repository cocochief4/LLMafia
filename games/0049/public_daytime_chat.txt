[13:43:42] Ari: lets try sorting out our suspicions quickly
[13:43:45] Frankie: anyone notice alex is silent today
[13:43:45] Emerson: hello
[13:43:46] Ronny: i have no strong suspicions at this point
[13:43:47] Addison: im thinking we should start by naming who was unusually quiet
[13:43:52] Ari: anyone seem unusually quiet this morning
[13:43:57] Ronny: seems like alex isnt chiming in today
[13:43:58] Frankie: sam seems to be steering the convo a lot feels off
[13:43:59] Addison: alex any thoughts on who seems suspicious today
[13:43:59] Emerson: not really
[13:44:05] Ari: we havent heard much from emerson since hello
[13:44:07] Emerson: who is alex? he is not in the game?
[13:44:09] Addison: sam jumps to conclusions too fast
[13:44:09] Frankie: maybe alex just stepped away for coffee
[13:44:12] Ronny: id say emerson hasnt been super chatty either
[13:44:17] Emerson: who is same? he is also not in the game?
[13:44:21] Frankie: emerson pretending not to know alex seems suspicious
[13:44:23] Addison: im sorry i meant ari not alex
[13:44:27] Emerson: ronny you are quick to be pointing fingers
[13:44:28] Ronny: emerson you have been quiet too what do you think
[13:44:35] Frankie: sam and ari echoing each other so quickly feels strange
[13:44:36] Addison: that is strange emerson acts clueless
[13:44:37] Ari: nobody named alex here sounds like a distraction move
[13:44:40] Ronny: sam it would help to know why you seem off
[13:44:42] Emerson: Possibly
[13:44:52] Addison: anyone else find it weird that people keep talking about alex
[13:44:53] Ari: lets settle who alex and sam are before casting votes
[13:44:54] Ronny: lets drop the alex distraction and focus on real chat contributions
[13:44:55] Emerson: Who is sam? there is no sam in the game

[13:46:11] Ronny: frankie can you explain why you voted for emerson
[13:46:21] Frankie: i find ronny steering chat too effortlessly suspicious
[13:46:23] Ronny: lets keep an eye on ari and frankie
[13:46:24] Ari: maybe we pause on emerson until we have more clues
[13:46:36] Frankie: emerson had no solid reasons when pressed for input
[13:46:38] Ari: same ronny could you explain a bit more
[13:46:49] Ronny: we should slow down and point out actual odd behavior instead of random names
[13:46:53] Ari: frankie can you share your specific reasons for suspecting ronny
[13:47:02] Ronny: frankie i need to hear your reasons for accusing me

[13:47:20] Frankie: ronny offered no clear motive when pointing at me
[13:47:21] Ronny: i got suspicious of frankie for focusing on me instead of pointing out clear odd actions
